\chaptermark{Conclusions}

This concluding chapter aims to summarize and synthesize the dissertation's research into the practices and technologies of matching identity data within migration management and border control, focusing on the influence of transnational commercialized security infrastructures. Throughout the dissertation, we explored the practices and technologies of matching identity data, aiming to understand the types of knowledge and assumptions inscribed in data models, the technologies organizations use to search and match identity data, and the circulation of data matching knowledge and technology across organizations. This last chapter begins by reviewing the research questions and key findings from the previous chapters based on empirical evidence. Next, the importance of these findings will be interpreted in more detail, and their theoretical and practical implications will be discussed. Lastly, the chapter will reflect on the research process and outline potential directions for future research.

## Restatement of the main research question and summary of the research

The primary focus of this dissertation was to investigate the practices and technologies for matching identity data in data infrastructure for migration management and border control. The research sought to understand the interplay between data matching, identification systems, and transnational security infrastructure to understand the internationalization, commercialization, and securitization of identification through the materiality and performativity of data matching practices and technologies. By examining this interplay, the dissertation aimed to uncover the implications for individuals, organizations, and broader transnational security contexts. Specifically, the dissertation addressed the following overarching research question:

> How are practices and technologies for matching identity data in migration management and border control shaping and shaped by transnational commercialized security infrastructures?

Through this research question, the dissertation sought to contribute to a more performative understanding of the role of data matching technology and its impact on the meaning of data, practices, and the organizations that employ it. In Chapter 1, the dissertation's goal of examining data matching in transnational data infrastructures was broken down into several research objectives that were taken up in the subsequent chapters. Firstly, Chapter 2 mapped the theoretical landscape related to internationalization, securitization, and infrastructuring of identification, deriving the research questions and hypotheses that guided our investigation into data matching in transnational commercialized security infrastructures. Chapter 3 developed a comprehensive methodological framework to analyze data matching practices and technologies within transnational infrastructures, focusing on uncovering embedded technical details through different infrastructural inversion strategies.

Next, Chapter 4 introduced a novel method and software tool designed to analyze the underlying schemas of information systems in population management. This approach gave us insights into authorities' imaginaries about people on the move and the corresponding intricacies of data interoperability and matching. Chapter 5 examined the relationship between identity data matching technologies and routine identification practices, shedding light on the practical implications and challenges organizations encounter when trying to match identity data to re-identify individuals within and across organizations. Lastly, Chapter 6 investigated the long-term development of identification systems and the establishment of transnational data infrastructures. The chapter investigated the circulation of commercial data matching software throughout its lifecycle. Specifically, how significant moments --- such as shifts in the meanings attributed to the software from a generic data matching engine to a security tool or its use as a bridge to connect disparate data systems --- influence the practices and technologies employed in transnational security infrastructures.

The following section will proceed with a summary of the Chapters' findings, delving deeper into their implications and providing an overview of the key themes and insights that emerged from the research.

## Overview of the findings

This section highlights and interprets some key findings from the empirical investigations conducted in this dissertation. The presented findings highlight the interplay between practices, technologies, and transnational security infrastructures within the context of matching identity data in migration management and border control.

### Chapter 4: "The Ontology Explorer: A method to make visible data infrastructures for population management

Chapter 4 contributes to the research objective of introducing a new method and software tool to analyze the schemas underpinning information systems in population management. The "Ontology Explorer" (OE) methodology and tool help achieve this objective by enabling a systematic examination and comparison of non-homogeneous data models used in diverse information systems. The chapter utilizes the OE method, based on schema matching techniques and STS research on classifications and standards, to bring attention to the assumptions embedded in the data models used in information systems for population management.

The infrastructural inversion strategy employed in Chapter 4 compared data models to uncover authorities' imaginaries and expectations about people on the move embedded within the technical standards of data infrastructures. Chapter 4 thus addresses research question 1 (_Which types of knowledge and assumptions about people-on-the-move are inscribed in data models of national and transnational security infrastructures? What implications does this have for how organizations can search and match identity data?_), through an illustrative analysis of the types of knowledge and assumptions about people-on-the-move inscribed in data models of national and transnational authorities. The illustrative analysis demonstrated how the OE can be used to make visible the implicit knowledge and assumptions in data infrastructures for population management. The findings indicate that there are different conceptualizations of identity data among authorities involved in population management, which could have implications for matching data across various database systems. For example, the Eurodac system primarily collects fingerprint data and does not include biographical details such as name, date of birth, and nationality. Therefore, the only means of matching data with Eurodac are biometric matching methods or linking data using the Eurodac number.

Chapter 4 also aids in answering the main research question by revealing the implicit assumptions and patterns within information systems design. Through applying the OE methodology, the chapter introduces a new method and tool and illustrates its use to make the less visible assumptions and patterns embedded within information systems visible. As such, it also provides insights into how identity data models can influence the creation and circulation of data and the relationships between different authorities' data models. By analyzing the similarities and differences between various data models, we can discover the underlying mechanisms that enable data matching processes and comprehend how different data models may impact matching results within transnational data infrastructures.

### Chapter 5: "From registration to re-identification: Exploring the interplay of data matching software in routine identification practices,"

Chapter 5 investigated the relationship between identity data matching technologies and routine identification practices within migration management. This chapter's findings pointed to how data matching software technology influences identification practices. The chapter primarily employs the infrastructural inversion strategy of data practices to examine the influence of identity data matching technologies on routine identification practices. The findings demonstrate how searching, matching, linking, and deduplicating identity data in data infrastructures shape, transform, and stabilize identification processes.

Chapter 5 addresses Research Question 2 (_How do organizations that collect information about people-on-the-move search and match for identity data in their systems? How is data about people-on-the-move matched and linked across different agencies and organizations?_) to explore how organizations collecting information about people-on-the-move search for and match identity data in their systems, as well as how data about such individuals is matched and linked across different agencies and organizations. Through empirical investigation, the chapter focuses on the case of the Dutch government migration and asylum agency and its utilization of a data matching software package. The chapter introduces the concept of re-identification to capture various iterative identification processes, such as retrieving someone's corresponding identity data in databases or determining if multiple database records (possibly from different organizations) reference the same real-world person. The findings indicate four significant influences of the software package on the agency's bureaucratic re-identification practices.

A first influence is the software's design, which incorporates expectations of uncertainty during database searches to account for potential errors in search queries and database records. Based on fuzzy search algorithms and probability-based ranking of matches, the software's design mediates all applicant searches, whether performed by humans or automated systems. As such, this finding underscores the role of data matching software in shaping the agency's re-identification practices by accommodating the inherent uncertainties in identity data. Secondly, the software package influences re-identification practices by assembling knowledge about identity data, facilitating equivalences between disparate practices. By replacing and enhancing the IND agency personnel's knowledge of identity data and re-identification, the findings show the software's potential to redistribute identification skills and knowledge within the agency, influencing routine identification practices.

The materiality of identity data emerges as a third influence on bureaucratic re-identification practices. The use of the software package was primarily related to the searching and matching of alphanumeric identity data, as compared to biometric identity. The findings suggest that the shape identity data, such as alphanumeric/biographical data versus biometric data, intrinsically impact the strategies and constraints involved in re-identification processes. In short, the materialities of more loosely defined biographic data versus more strictly defined biometric data facilitate and constrain bureaucratic re-identification in different ways.

The fourth influence on re-identification is related to how the agency's information systems structure affects how re-identification practices are carried out. The system's service-oriented architecture, with its separation of the searching and matching functionality from other system components, offers benefits in terms of efficiency and maintenance. However, the drawback is the system's limited consideration of the context in which searches are performed, limiting its effectiveness in specific scenarios. The current software architecture may have the unintended consequence of treating all users (staff from the agency's various units as well as automated systems) as passive participants with little understanding of re-identification's social and material circumstances.

The analysis in Chapter 5 reveals that the way organizations identify applicants is affected by the design and application of data matching software. This influence of data matching software was especially evident in the processes of re-identifying applicants in daily bureaucratic processes, thus stressing how identification is more than the initial collection and registration of biographic and biometric data from applicants. The chapter demonstrates the benefit of examining lesser-known technologies and practices for data matching, which allow individuals to be identified across various data infrastructures. However, the study also highlights the potential drawbacks of using such software, including specific organizational costs.

### Chapter 6: "Uncovering the long-term development of identification infrastructures: A multi-temporal perspective"

Chapter 6 delved into the evolution of identification systems and the construction of transnational security infrastructures. The chapter's findings contribute to the research objective of exploring the lifecycle of identification systems, identifying pivotal moments, and examining how data matching expertise circulates among various actors and organizations. This chapter explores the development of identification systems and transnational data infrastructures by investigating the evolution of a commercial data matching software package. It analyzes the different procedures and factors that influenced the software's development and the organizations involved in its creation and use.

The chapter analyzed the evolution of technology and design over time by taking a longitudinal perspective and adopting the infrastructural inversion strategy of sociotechnical change. The chapter proposes two heuristic devices to identify pivotal moments: first, the changing interpretive flexibility of the software package and second, the gateway moments when identification systems intersect with broader infrastructures. The first heuristic suggests that changes in the interpretive flexibility of the software, as per SCOT, are significant moments that can provide valuable insight into how actors approach identification issues. The second heuristic proposes examining gateway moments, as per infrastructure studies, which involve making compromises when integrating identification systems into more extensive infrastructures. These two heuristics were applied to analyzing a commercial data matching software package's empirical case to reveal the interactions between technology suppliers and organizations, offering insights into the infrastructuring of identification.

In this way, the chapter addresses Research Question 3 (_How does knowledge and technology for matching identity data circulate and travel across organizations?_) by exploring the networks, actors, and organizations involved in developing and disseminating data matching technologies. Concerning the main research question, the chapter's analysis illuminates the relationship between identification practices, commercialized data matching technologies, and transnational security infrastructures. The chapter offers insights into how globally honed technologies are adjusted to new contexts by uncovering the compromises and adaptations required when building identification infrastructures. Furthermore, the activities of software vendors, often overlooked actors, are revealed as they distribute and reuse software packages, thereby influencing the long-term development of identification practices and infrastructures.

Significant findings from Chapter 6 arose by looking at the moments of interpretative flexibility and analyzing moments when the software package demonstrated gateway-like characteristics. In short, moments of interpretative flexibility provided insights into how a private company became enrolled in security logic through shifts in identification problems and solutions. The software was initially created as a versatile tool for data matching across industries but was later tailored to meet specific needs like border security and migration management. This change influenced the interpretative flexibility of data matching when addressing the problem of identification. The design of the technology closed down to address specific requirements and challenges of identification in border security and migration management. The development of matching functions incorporating multicultural name matching and biometrics coincided with more significant socio-political movements and an increased focus on identifying potential security threats. Additionally, focusing on these pivotal moments made it apparent that networks were formed to secure contracts for developing identification systems for various states.

The chapter also explored the role of gateway technologies in bridging heterogeneous data systems and practices, acting as crucial components in establishing and maintaining networks within larger-scale infrastructures. Compared to other analytical lenses, the gateway framing forces us to consider the intricate technical and logistical challenges of integrating different identification systems. Conceptualizing data matching software as a gateway suggests the technology's significance as a practical component in harmonizing and facilitating communication within the broader identification infrastructure. The reusability of gateways furthermore suggests how data matching systems can effectively transport identification expertise across organizations through its identity- and name-matching features. This helped to demonstrate how data matching knowledge and expertise can circulate between different actors and organizations. These findings indicate how technologies and methods for matching identity data can spread and influence identification practices across various domains and settings.

## Discussion of theoretical and practical implications

This section discusses the theoretical implications of the research findings and how each chapter contributed to existing theoretical frameworks and concepts in its respective area of focus.

### Chapter 4

In Chapter 4, the introduction of the Ontology Explorer method and tool expands on methodological innovations in infrastructure studies and digital methods to analyze information systems for population management. The chapter highlights the potential for innovative methodological contributions in analyzing diverse organizations by examining the semantic level of information systems' data models. Methodologically, the chapter emphasizes the importance of finding correspondences between data models for data matching and integration, thus revealing the interconnections between technical details and the politics of knowledge production. This analysis enhances our understanding of the data models used in information systems and their role in revealing how authorities envision managing populations.

In Chapter 4, the practical and theoretical implications of the research findings are twofold. Firstly, the Ontology Explorer (OE) method introduces a means to account for resistance within information systems. Using the OE to analyze "thin" data models, researchers can identify differences and absences between systems, which can serve as the basis for critical analyses. This method allows for the detection of discrepancies between what is represented in the data models and the actual use of the systems, providing valuable insights into power dynamics and potential areas of intervention. Ethnographic observations can complement the findings from the OE, leading to a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of information systems.

Secondly, the OE method contributes to ongoing discussions on the politics of data and data-driven governance. While digital sociology often focuses on user-generated content, interventions into data need to examine existing structures, such as the underlying data models. The OE has the potential to present and analyze data models in unique ways, allowing for experimental forms of participation and speculation on alternate ways to represent data about populations. By engaging with the technicalities of information infrastructures rather than solely relying on textual content, the OE facilitates critical engagements with collected categories of data. This could open up opportunities for actors typically treated as data subjects to become active participants in rethinking and reshaping data practices, leading to more inclusive and transformative approaches to data governance.

Overall, Chapter 4 highlights the potential of the OE method to uncover resistance and power dynamics within information systems and to foster more participatory and reflexive approaches to data governance. By focusing on the technical aspects of data models, the method offers a distinctive perspective that complements traditional qualitative approaches, providing researchers and practitioners with valuable tools for critical analysis and intervention in the politics of data.

### Chapter 5

Chapter 5 extends existing discussions on identification by emphasizing the broader scope of what the chapter refers to as re-identification practices. While previous research has often focused on initial registration and biometric data, this chapter highlights other processes of retrieving and matching identity data across databases and deduplication. This chapter addresses an area not covered in existing literature -- the use of data matching technologies in routine bureaucratic re-identification. As such, the chapter's findings offer valuable insights into the dynamics of identification practices. These findings expand our theoretical understanding of identification beyond its initial stages and underscore the importance of considering the influence of data matching technologies in identity management.

Chapter 5 presents several practical implications that emerge from the study of re-identification practices and the use of search and match tools. The search and match tools discussed in the chapter are considered practical tools to help users avoid such mistakes and ensure the accuracy of re-identification processes. By utilizing these tools more effectively, organizations can reduce errors and enhance the overall quality of identification data. However, the focus on data matching in re-identification draws attention to the potential costs of data linking errors or incorrect data insertion in databases. Such errors can negatively impact individuals and organizations, leading to additional work to verify and rectify mistakes.

Secondly, the integration of identification systems with other databases or architectural components can introduce friction and confusion in the search process. Users often need to query multiple systems with different search and match engines, which can create discrepancies in search behaviours and query formulations. To address such problems, it would be beneficial for tools to consider the search behaviours of other systems and align them or provide an interface that can simultaneously translate and optimize queries for multiple systems. This integration and alignment would streamline the search process and reduce user confusion, enhancing the effectiveness of re-identification.

Thirdly, the separation of concerns and modularization of components in identification systems impact the search and match functionalities. Currently, the tools do not consider the context of a search, such as the user or the stage of the identification process. However, the findings indicated that users often have different needs and preferences regarding search functionalities. For instance, some users required more information on why a particular match result was included in the search results. In order to meet the different needs of users, it may be helpful to create new features in user applications that can help users create queries and understand search results. A more coherent integration between the backend search and the frontend user interface would also enhance the ease of use and the capabilities of the search tools.

### Chapter 6

In Chapter 6, the theoretical implications are twofold. Firstly, the chapter addresses methodological concerns by highlighting the impact of researchers' methodological decisions on the findings. By proposing two multitemporal sampling heuristics—moments of interpretative flexibility and gateway moments—, the chapter demonstrates the use of considering the temporal dimension when studying sociotechnologies of identification. This contribution adds to the ongoing theoretical discourse, as exemplified by the Biography of Artefacts and Practices Approach [@pollockSoftwareOrganisationsBiography2009], regarding methods used to comprehend the development and use of software systems. It broadens the scope of these discussions to include identification technologies, providing insight not only into the evolution of software, but also into the internationalization, commercialization, securitization, and infrastructuring of identification.

Secondly, this chapter examines how identification technology is commercialized and securitized through sociotechnical processes. By analyzing a specific case involving a software vendor's development of data matching technology, the chapter uncovers the relationships between technology, actors, and broader sociotechnical contexts. By applying heuristics to identify pivotal moments in the company's software development, the analysis reveals clear indications of the internationalization, commercialization, securitization, and infrastructuring of identification, as evidenced by studying the software's sociotechnical changes. The chapter's findings thus contribute to our understanding of how data matching and identification technologies shape and are shaped by transnational commercialized security infrastructures.

Chapter 6 presents several practical implications of applying a multi-temporal sampling approach and using interpretative flexibility and gateway moments as heuristics in studying identification technologies and infrastructures. Firstly, adopting a multi-temporal sampling approach in the field of IT in border and migration value broadens the analytical focus and opens up new avenues for inquiry. Research can trace the evolution of identification technologies by looking at significant moments of interpretative flexibility and gateway moments. By adopting this approach, we can gain a deeper understanding of the sociotechnical processes involved in the development and evolution of identification technologies rather than simply viewing identification systems as a final product.

Secondly, the heuristic of interpretative flexibility highlights the dynamic nature of identification technologies and practices. It emphasizes that technologies do not have fixed or stable meanings but are subject to interpretation and contestation by various social groups. This perspective highlights how different actors challenge or transform identification technologies and practices, influencing their trajectory and shaping outcomes. Understanding interpretative flexibility can provide insights into the possibilities for innovation, adaptation, and resistance in creating identification systems.

Thirdly, the heuristic of gateway moments underscores the importance of technologies in bridging heterogeneous data systems and practices within identification systems and infrastructures. Gateway technologies act as crucial connectors, filling gaps and facilitating the integration of diverse systems and communities of practice. They play a significant but often underappreciated role in establishing and maintaining networks within larger-scale infrastructures. Recognizing the role of gateway technologies can inform the design and implementation of identification systems, enabling better data integration, interoperability, and collaboration among different stakeholders.

This section discusses the theoretical and practical implications of the dissertation's findings and how they advance our understanding of identification technologies, infrastructures, and societal implications. The theoretical implications highlight the methodological innovations and the importance of considering data models, resistance, and the politics of data in analyzing information systems. Other findings deepen our theoretical understanding of the intricate between technical aspects and the broader socio-political context of identification practices in shaping and being shaped by transnational commercialized security infrastructures. On the practical side, the implications brought out the challenges and opportunities in re-identification processes, the integration of search and match tools, and the role of gateway technologies in bridging data systems. These practical implications can potentially inform identification system design, implementation, and improvement, ultimately contributing to more effective and accountable data matching and identification technologies.

Moving forward, the next section will reflect on the research process and discuss limitations encountered during the study. It will provide an opportunity to evaluate the methodology, data collection, and analysis techniques, discussing their strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, the section will address constraints or challenges faced throughout the research, such as data access limitations or the generalizability of findings. By reflecting on the research process and its inherent limitations, the dissertation aims to produce recommendations for future studies on identification technologies and transnational commercialized security infrastructures.

## Overview of the research process

The research process was guided by a methodological framework that leveraged data infrastructures as both a subject of investigation and a research resource. Drawing inspiration from Bowker and Star's notion of "infrastructural inversions," three distinct methodological strategies were employed: comparing data models, analyzing data practices, and tracing sociotechnical change. These strategies were integrated into a methodological framework, allowing for a comprehensive examination of the practices and technologies involved in matching identity data. By reversing the tendency of such infrastructure to recede into the background, this methodological framework made it possible to uncover the different aspects of matching identity data.

The first inversion strategy employed was the comparison of data models, which provided insights into the information collected by various authorities' information systems for population management. This work included collecting data models from EU and EU Member State authorities through desk research. Other researchers' contributions from the Processing Citizenship project also provided indirect traces of data models, such as screenshots of graphical user interfaces that provided evidence of categories of data collected in systems. Using these indirect traces of data models is related to our challenges: obtaining data models for systems in this sensitive area. Another challenge was figuring out how to compare various documents on data models, considering they are in different file formats and languages. 

Therefore, the introduced Ontology Explorer method dealt directly with those challenges. It successfully enabled us to compare diverse data models by employing additional steps to code, harmonize, and group all documents, categories, and values. The novelty came from integrating insights from existing classification and infrastructure studies and discourse analysis into a systematic method for analyzing data models. Additionally, drawing from an analysis of data models using the OE, @pelizzaScriptsAlterityMapping2023 built further on this work. This 2023 article thus described the different "scripts of alterity" of security subjects, highlighting how data infrastructures shape power dynamics among individuals and states. Furthermore, the OE tool used for this research has been released as open-source software [@vanrossemOntologyexplorer2021], enabling the analysis of information systems' data models in various domains and contexts beyond this research's scope.

The second infrastructural inversion strategy focused on analyzing data practices to understand the routine activities of searching and matching identity data within and across organizations. This analysis was based on data gathered through fieldwork and interviews at a software supplier specializing in commercial data matching tools and at one of the company's customers, the Netherlands's migration and asylum agency. To start the fieldwork, I analyzed technical documentation and held meetings at the company's headquarters to investigate their design for data matching software. The analysis provided valuable insights to create a semi-structured interview protocol to compare the design with actual usage (included in the Appendix).

During the research process, I collaborated with a UX designer from the software company who provided additional support and feedback for the interviews with the agency's staff members. In short, this approach to gaining insight into how the software was being used in practice was considered beneficial for all parties involved. The software company sought more data on their product's usage, while the agency benefited from the opportunity to gain insight into the challenges with the search and match features. However, limitations were encountered regarding access to fieldwork, interviews, and data, which will be discussed in the next section.

Therefore, the semi-structured interviews with staff members at the agency inquired about their routine activities of searching and matching data to gain insight into how they use the tools for matching identity data to identify applicants throughout the agency's bureaucratic procedures. 
The interview participants were selected from various departments within the agency to ensure the representation of users with diverse tasks and approach to utilizing the tools. Participants eventually included especially agency personnel that use the software in back-office information management tasks.

After conducting interviews, I analyzed and coded the data using a mixed approach (some examples are included in the Appendix). On the one hand, the coding was guided by questions and hypotheses, such as identifying the search strategies used by the agency's staff to identify applicants and categorizing the issues they encounter when processing data matches. However, the coding also allowed for inductive findings based on the responses. Overall, this approach helped me to understand the challenges faced by the agency in identifying applicants from sometimes ambiguous data and how these challenges relate to the software's capabilities. I compiled a report of my findings and shared it with the software company and the agency. They both responded positively to the report, and I was invited to present it at a company-wide online meeting for knowledge-sharing.

The third strategy of infrastructural inversion focused on tracing sociotechnical change, examining the circulation of knowledge, technologies, and practices associated with data matching across various organizations and over time. This part of the research was also based on fieldwork and interviews at the same software supplier creating commercial data matching tools. However, here the primary objective was to gain insights into the dynamic nature of transnational data infrastructures and uncover these systems' historical development and evolution. In addition to the oral histories and experiences shared in the interviews, I utilized old publicly available news articles, press releases, and interviews with the company CEO to gain a more comprehensive understanding and cross-reference the information.

Collecting this data made it possible to develop a longitudinal perspective on the development of the software and revealed noteworthy findings regarding these infrastructures' transformations, adaptations, and challenges. Here, the data analysis was driven more by writing memos to connect the dots of the software's evolution rather than focusing on data coding. Exploring the historical trajectories of the software through this data revealed the sociotechnical networks involved in the transnational dissemination of identification technologies, the growth of commercial solutions within the field, and the intricate interplay between identification practices and broader security agendas. For example, I used the company's participation in an international competition sponsored by a US research organization. The competition aimed to find innovative name matching solutions. Through analyzing the various parties involved, I was able to identify links between technological advancements, market dynamics, and security imperatives. This process helped me understand how identification processes have evolved and intertwined within their socio-political landscapes.

This section has provided an overview of the research process employed in this study. Using the methodological framework inspired by "infrastructural inversions," the research explored data infrastructures as both a topic and a resource. Three methodological strategies were used, including comparing data models, analyzing data practices, and tracing sociotechnical change. These strategies enabled examining the interplay between identification systems and the internationalization, commercialization, and securitization of identification. Through data collection methods such as desk research, fieldwork, and interviews, the research developed new perspectives on the information collected by organizations, the everyday data practices of matching data and re-identification, and the dynamic nature of transnational commercialized security infrastructures. However, it is necessary to acknowledge the limitations and challenges faced during the research process. The next section will further reflect on the findings, including unexpected discoveries and the implications of the limitations encountered.

## Reflection on findings and limitations

While conducting research, I discovered some surprising findings that indicate how a company's software is integrated affects how customers use it for data matching and identity management. Specifically, these findings challenged my assumptions about the data matching tools, as the software's integration in systems such as the Netherlands' migration and asylum was relatively invisible to users. Also, I was surprised to discover that the software was adaptable and effective across different domains, which challenges traditional notions about the difficulty of adapting generic software to local circumstances. However, throughout the research, several limitations also arose that had a direct impact on the findings I was able to produce. In this section, I will examine the unexpected results, discuss the identified limitations, and reflect on the research outcomes.

### Surprising and unexpected findings

Chapter 5 revealed unexpected insights about how the company's software integrates with the systems of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (IND). The findings revealed that the software's service-oriented architecture facilitated its integration, but it did not always cater to the specific needs of all users. On the one hand, this loose integration through this software architecture facilitated integration at the cost of making the search almost invisible to most users, which led to a lack of awareness about how the underlying data matching mechanisms work. In the field of STS, there is a commonly held belief that software solutions designed for one particular context are inherently limited and challenging to modify for use in different settings. However, this chapter provides evidence to support the opposing viewpoint, showing how generic data matching software can be adjusted to fit local contexts, albeit with some associated costs. On the other hand, the diverse use cases of search and data matching within the IND suggest that tighter integration with the local context and the system's graphical user interface could have provided valuable context to end users, explaining, for instance, why specific search results were included. During interviews, I discovered that users need clarification when search results include matches based on a person's historical data, such as a match on previous names before marriage. Such findings emphasize the importance of improving the user experience to ensure a clear understanding of search results.

Chapter 6 revealed intriguing findings that suggest the significant role of software integrators and suppliers. The research delved into the complex relationship between the company as a technology supplier and its relation with technology integrators, unearthing a competitive landscape within identification solutions. Notably, the research explored the company's involvement in border and security domains, which was influenced by the evolving landscape following the events of 9/11 in the United States. This exploration also revealed the company's ventures into biometrics and multimodal approaches that match combinations of biometric and biographic data, offering insights into the dynamic nature of its technological advancements. 

The research drew inspiration from the biography of artefacts and practices approach to question the traditional idea of identification systems as unchanging and complete projects. Surprisingly, the research revealed that the company's core data matching technology has mostly stayed the same in recent years, despite its focus on developing passenger information systems. This highlights the impact of the older development processes on these systems. Additionally, despite the dynamic relationships between software integrators, suppliers, and the socio-political landscape within the industry, there is notable stability in the matching knowledge that demonstrates how the industry evolves and yet remains constant.

### Limitations

During this research, several limitations were encountered that are essential to grasp to understand the scope and implications of the study. These limitations impacted the breadth and depth of the investigation, making it necessary to consider them when interpreting the research findings. 

Firstly, we planned to conduct fieldwork in EU institutions to study identity data, data quality in border security and migration management, and the technological solutions used. However, we faced significant challenges due to access restrictions and typical barriers to qualitative secrecy research. We could not access the intended fieldwork site, which resulted in considerable time wasted in establishing contacts and developing a project proposal for a traineeship with an EU agency. Essentially, we could not agree on ownership and use of the research data that would be produced. Instead, we decided to establish new fieldwork research by collaborating with a data matching technology supplier for the agency.[^positionality]

[^positionality]: As the researcher conducting this study, I believe that my background played a meaningful role in assisting me access the fieldwork. Being a white male with an academic background in computer science and experience in software development, I was able to speak the same language as my interlocutors, which facilitated communication and ensured better understanding of their perspectives. Moreover, my knowledge of Dutch and being based in the Netherlands helped to establish trustworthiness with the participants. It is worth mentioning that the research was conducted under the EU funded project Processing Citizenship, which added to its credibility and relevance.

The research project with the data matching software company was made more challenging due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially, the research had to be postponed due to safety measures and travel restrictions in The Netherlands. Later, the research had to be conducted online, which reduced opportunities for in-person visits and observations during fieldwork. This lack of face-to-face interactions and direct observations may have limited the research's ability to comprehend the intricacies and implications of software usage fully.

The study had limitations due to the decision to concentrate mainly on the EU Visa Information System and the Netherlands 'migration and asylum agency systems rather than investigating the company's advancements in advanced passenger information systems. This decision aligned with the broader goals of the Processing Citizenship project, but it restricted the inquiry to specific projects in the company's portfolio; some other relevant customers would also necessitate security clearances. Additionally, obtaining relevant documentation about the use of data matching software in the EU-VIS system proved to be challenging due to the company's limited access to EU documentation and confidentiality practices by the technology integrator, which hindered the researchers' ability to delve deeply into the intricacies of software implementation and its influence on identity data management within the EU context. Thus, the research in Chapter 5 focused on The Netherlands' immigration and asylum agency, while it was initially hoped also to include connections with EU-VIS.

Notwithstanding these limitations, the study certainly adds to our understanding of how commercial data matching software's integration shapes and shapes transnational security infrastructures. By acknowledging these limitations, we can recognize the difficulties of researching technology in the field of security, including gaining access to fieldwork and dealing with secrecy. Overall, collaborating with a technology supplier actually made it possible to lesser-known aspects of identification and identity management, specifically data matching and the broader contexts in which these technologies are used. In the following section, I will discuss some ethical considerations I had while working on the collaboration and conducting the research.

## Ethical considerations

During the research process, I, of course, had some ethical considerations, especially since the company operates in the domain of borders and security. Working with a company that deals with borders and security raised ethical concerns about the possible impact of their technology on individuals' privacy and security and how my findings would help the company further develop its software.

Through my interviews with IND personnel, I also observed the benefits of data matching in streamlining bureaucratic processes for both employees and applicants. The software proved to help support daily tasks, but particular challenges hindered efficient work. For example, I noted in my report that a check is not automatically conducted to determine if an applicant already exists in the agency's database. This minor technical issue results in the creation of duplicate data, which must then be cleaned up. However, this problem is not easily solved as it requires a clear and reliable definition of what constitutes a duplicate. Imagine a scenario where an applicant's information is being processed, and one or more automatic matches are found based on a person's data in the database sharing a similar name and year of birth. These matches need to be analyzed carefully as data matching systems generate matches based on such similarities. But the question is, what defines a genuine duplicate match? Additionally, identifying possible matches can also raise concerns about identity fraud.

Even though Chapter 6 revealed important information about the development of data matching software, it also highlighted my ethical concerns. Specifically, the scientific approach to handling Arabic and Asian names could unintentionally reinforce existing profiling categories that unfairly target specific people. Through the development of the name matching expertise and technology, such ue to linguistic or transliteration differences, names from these groups could be disproportionately flagged as potential matches. This overrepresentation in the flagged category could reinforce harmful stereotypes and marginalize certain communities. This issue could become even more significant with the company's software being used in airline information systems. It is crucial to thoroughly evaluate these technological solutions' potential consequences and unintended effects. Unfortunately, these systems are frequently designed as opaque "black boxes" not subject to public scrutiny. I suspect that this issue is exacerbated when commercial entities and their proprietary technologies get involved.

Building upon the methodological strategies employed, the data collection process, and the reflection on findings, this research has significantly contributed to understanding data infrastructures, identity management, and the implications of data matching practices. By examining the integration of the company's software into various systems and organizations, unexpected insights were gained, challenging conventional assumptions and highlighting the role of sociotechnical factors in shaping data matching processes. Moreover, the limitations encountered during the research process demonstrate the complexities of studying sensitive domains and navigating access restrictions. These contributions and ethical considerations provide a comprehensive foundation for understanding the multifaceted dynamics of data matching and its impact on individuals and systems. In the following section, the contributions and significance of this research will be further explored and discussed.

## Future research directions

Several avenues for future research warrant exploration to address knowledge gaps, anticipate emerging technological developments, advance methodologies, foster interdisciplinary collaborations, and explore practical applications of data matching and other identification technologies in transnational commercialized security infrastructures.

Further research is needed to analyze how new technologies, such as generative artificial intelligence and biometrics, affect identification systems. The integration of these technologies can have a significant impact on identification. It is necessary to examine these technologies' potential benefits and risks and consider ethical and policy considerations. Robust governance mechanisms are necessary to safeguard individual rights while promoting accountability and transparency in using these technologies. For example, machine learning-based matching for data matching can pose challenges compared to rules-based matching. It can pose a challenge for individuals suspected of identity fraud to explain and understand the match making it difficult to dispute a false positive result.

Improving research methods can help us better understand identification systems. To achieve this, future research should explore new approaches like combining qualitative and quantitative methods used in this dissertation. Such methods can provide novel insights into the complexities of identification systems. Therefore, working across different fields is crucial for understanding identification systems. Engaging researchers from computer science, sociology, law, ethics, and policy will give us comprehensive perspectives and insights. Future research should encourage interdisciplinary collaborations to tackle identification systems' many challenges and implications.

It would be helpful to conduct further research on how identification systems are used in real-life situations to connect academic theories with practical applications. Investigating the technicalities of specific identification technologies in identification in domains like healthcare, finance, and public administration can provide valuable insights into their benefits and risks. Additionally, collaborating with experts in various fields can aid in shaping the social impact of identification systems at an earlier stage, informing policymaking decisions, and promoting inclusive identification systems.

## Final reflections and concluding remarks

<!-- In the "Final Reflections and Concluding Remarks" section of the dissertation, we summarize this research's key findings and contributions while providing a broader perspective on its implications. Throughout this study, we explored the intricate dynamics of identification systems and data infrastructures, employing a multi-method approach encompassing data model analysis, examining data practices, and tracing sociotechnical change. By adopting this methodological framework, we were able to shed light on the often overlooked aspects of infrastructure, uncovering its influence on everyday practices and exposing the need for critical engagement.

One of the main findings of this research lies in the power of comparative analysis of data models. Through this approach, we gained insights into the information collected by different organizations and systems, highlighting discrepancies and commonalities that affect individual rights and administrative processes. Analyzing data practices further deepened our understanding of the complexities of searching and matching identity data, revealing integration, usability, and system interconnectivity challenges. These insights offer valuable guidance for designing and improving identification systems, emphasizing the importance of aligning user needs with technological capabilities.

Tracing sociotechnical change allowed us to observe the circulation of knowledge, technologies, and practices in data matching over time and across organizations. We discovered unexpected connections between software suppliers, integrators, and their customers, illuminating the intricate networks within identification infrastructures. These findings challenge simplistic narratives and highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of the sociotechnical dynamics that shape identification practices.

Reflecting on the research process, we acknowledge certain limitations and areas for further exploration. The inability to access fieldwork sites due to qualitative secrecy research barriers restricted our investigation. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic also limited in-person fieldwork and interviews, necessitating a shift to online research methods. Additionally, focusing on specific projects and domains within the company's portfolio may have limited our understanding of broader developments and contexts.

Ethical considerations played a crucial role throughout this study. We navigated the ethical complexities of collaborating with a company operating in the borders and security domain, acknowledging the potential insecurities associated with these practices. However, our research also revealed the value of data matching in streamlining bureaucratic processes and supporting efficient decision-making, emphasizing the importance of balanced perspectives and critical engagement in shaping ethical practices.

In conclusion, this dissertation has contributed to understanding identification systems and data infrastructures by employing a comprehensive research approach. Our findings offer insights into the inner workings of these systems, highlighting the challenges and opportunities for improving their functionality and alignment with user needs. By uncovering the sociotechnical dimensions of identification practices, we have provided a foundation for future research in this field. Ultimately, this work calls for continued interdisciplinary collaboration and critical inquiry to ensure the development of responsible, inclusive, and practical identification systems in an ever-evolving technological landscape. -->
