\chaptermark{Conclusions}

This concluding chapter aims to summarize and synthesize the dissertation's research into the practices and technologies of matching identity data within migration management and border control, focusing on the influences of and on transnational commercialized security infrastructures. Throughout the dissertation, we explored the practices and technologies of matching identity data, aiming to understand the types of knowledge and assumptions inscribed in data models, the technologies organizations use to search and match identity data, and the circulation of data matching knowledge and technology across organizations. This last chapter begins by reviewing the research questions and key findings from the previous chapters based on empirical evidence. Next, the importance of these findings will be interpreted in more detail, and their theoretical and practical implications will be discussed. Lastly, the chapter will reflect on the research process and outline potential directions for future research.

## Restatement of the main research question and summary of the research

The primary focus of this dissertation was to investigate the practices and technologies for matching identity data in data infrastructure for migration management and border control. The research sought to understand the interplay between data matching, identification systems, and transnational security infrastructure to understand the internationalization, commercialization, and securitization of identification through the materiality and performativity of data matching practices and technologies. By examining this interplay, the dissertation aimed to uncover the implications for individuals, organizations, and broader transnational security contexts. Specifically, the dissertation addressed the following overarching research question:

> How are practices and technologies for matching identity data in migration management and border control shaping and shaped by transnational commercialized security infrastructures?

Through this research question, the dissertation sought to contribute to a more performative understanding of the role of data matching technology and its impact on the meaning of data, practices, and the organizations that employ it. In Chapter 1, the dissertation's goal of examining data matching in transnational data infrastructures was broken down into several research objectives that were taken up in the subsequent chapters. Firstly, Chapter 2 mapped the theoretical landscape related to internationalization, securitization, and infrastructuring of identification, deriving the research questions and hypotheses that guided our investigation into data matching in transnational commercialized security infrastructures. Chapter 3 developed a comprehensive methodological framework wherein data matching serves as both a research topic and a resource to investigate the internationalization, commercialization, securitization, and infrastructuring of identification.

Next, Chapter 4 introduced a novel method and software tool designed to analyze the underlying schemas of information systems in population management. This approach gave us insights into authorities' imaginaries about people on the move and the corresponding intricacies of data interoperability and matching. Chapter 5 examined the relationship between identity data matching technologies and routine identification practices, demonstrating the practical implications and challenges organizations encounter when trying to match identity data to re-identify individuals within and across organizations. Lastly, Chapter 6 investigated the circulation of commercial data matching software throughout its lifecycle. Specifically, how significant moments --- such as shifts in the meanings attributed to the software from a generic data matching engine to a security tool or its use as a bridge to connect disparate identification systems --- influence the practices and technologies employed in transnational security infrastructures.

The following section will proceed with a summary of the dissertation's findings, delving deeper into their implications and providing an overview of the key themes and insights that emerged from the research.

## Overview of the findings

This section summarizes key findings from empirical investigations conducted in the dissertation. Findings are connected to research objectives, questions and the use of methdological framework's infrastructural inversion strategy.

### Chapter 4: "The Ontology Explorer: A method to make visible data infrastructures for population management"

Chapter 4 contributes to the research objective of introducing a new method and software tool to analyze the schemas underpinning information systems in population management. The "Ontology Explorer" (OE) methodology and tool help achieve this objective by enabling a systematic examination and comparison of non-homogeneous data models used in diverse information systems. The chapter utilizes the OE method, based on schema matching techniques and STS research on classifications and standards, to bring attention to the assumptions embedded in the data models used in information systems for population management.

The infrastructural inversion strategy employed in Chapter 4 compared data models to uncover authorities' imaginaries and expectations about people on the move embedded within the technical standards of data infrastructures. Chapter 4 thus addresses research question 1 (_Which types of knowledge and assumptions about people-on-the-move are inscribed in data models of national and transnational security infrastructures? What implications does this have for how organizations can search and match identity data?_), through an illustrative analysis of the types of knowledge and assumptions about people-on-the-move inscribed in data models of national and transnational authorities. The illustrative analysis demonstrated how the OE can be used to make visible the implicit knowledge and assumptions in data infrastructures for population management. The findings indicate that there are different conceptualizations of identity data among authorities involved in population management, which could have implications for matching data across various database systems. For example, the Eurodac system primarily collects fingerprint data and does not include biographical details such as name, date of birth, and nationality. Therefore, the only means of matching data with Eurodac are biometric matching methods or linking data using the Eurodac number.

Chapter 4 also aids in answering the main research question by revealing the implicit assumptions and patterns within information systems design. Through applying the OE methodology, the chapter introduces a new method and tool and illustrates its use to make the less visible assumptions and patterns embedded within information systems visible. As such, it also provides insights into how identity data models can influence the creation and circulation of data and the relationships between different authorities' data models. 

### Chapter 5: "From registration to re-identification: Exploring the interplay of data matching software in routine identification practices,"

Chapter 5 contributes to the dissertation's research objective of examining the relationships between identity data matching technologies and routine identification practices. It addresses Research Question 2 (_How do organizations that collect information about people-on-the-move search and match for identity data in their systems? How is data about people-on-the-move matched and linked across different agencies and organizations?_). To address this question, the chapter conducts an empirical investigation, centring on the iterative processes of identifying applicants within the Dutch government migration and asylum agency and the role of a data matching system in these processes. Re-identification is introduced to conceptualize the multifaceted iterative identification procedures, including retrieving corresponding identity data from databases and determining whether multiple database records, potentially originating from different organizations, pertain to the same real-world individual.

Utilizing the second infrastructural inversion strategy, this chapter explores the practices surrounding identity matching and linking across data infrastructures. In doing so, it reveals a considerable diversity in re-identification practices within the IND, which manifests in two primary dimensions. Firstly, these practices vary regarding the information accessible to staff during the process. Secondly, they exhibit differences in the precision criteria required for successful re-identification. Building upon these findings, the chapter introduces an interpretative framework that categorizes re-identification practices based on the specific requirements for interpreting search inputs and results. This framework yields a matrix, acknowledging re-identification as a multifaceted process rather than a singular activity. It encompasses a spectrum of iterative practices, spanning diverse scenarios such as direct applicant interactions, telephone conversations managed by staff, handling application forms received through postal services, and automated re-identification procedures.

The chapter's findings emphasize the various practices of re-identification that can be impeded by data friction, potentially resulting in failed re-identification. The analysis identified three prominent forms of data friction that may hinder applicant re-identification: friction between standardized identification and the differences in institutional practices, friction from variations in the precision and accuracy of identity data during its transformation across different mediums and use in formulating search queries, and friction arising from the opaque calculation of match results and the need for thorough interpretation and fine-tuning of search results. These forms of friction, in turn, prompted a closer examination of the costs arising from failed re-identification, as exemplified by the existence of duplicate records and the labour-intensive process of deduplication.

### Chapter 6: "Uncovering the long-term development of identification infrastructures: A multi-temporal perspective"

Chapter 6 delved into the evolution of a data matching system and the construction of transnational security infrastructures. The chapter's findings contribute to the research objective of exploring the evolution of identification systems, identifying pivotal moments, and examining how data matching expertise circulates among various actors and organizations. The evolution of a commercial data matching system is thus used to investigate more extenstive long-term developments of identification systems and transnational data infrastructures.

The chapter uses the third infrastructural inversion strategy of sociotechnical change to trace the evolution of data matching technology and design. The strategy is operationalized using a "multi-temporal sampling" approach, offering an alternative to conventional longitudinal studies for exploring the contingent processes shaped by and shaping identification systems and infrastructures. The chapter proposes two heuristic devices to identify contingent moments: first, the changing interpretive flexibility of the system and second, the gateway moments when identification systems intersect with broader infrastructures. The first heuristic suggests that changes in the interpretive flexibility of the software, as per SCOT, are analytically valuable moments that can provide insight into how a system's design is contingent upon specific circumstances and social groups. The second heuristic proposes examining gateway moments, as per infrastructure studies, which involve making compromises when integrating separate systems into more extensive infrastructures. These two heuristics were applied to analyze the contingencies in the evolution of a commercial data matching system thereby providing insinght into the internationzalization, commercialization, securitization, and infrastructuring of identification.

In this way, the chapter addresses Research Question 3 (_How does knowledge and technology for matching identity data circulate and travel across organizations?_) by exploring the networks of people and organizations involved in developing and disseminating data matching technologies. Concerning the main research question, the chapter's analysis offers insights into how globally honed technologies are adjusted to new contexts by uncovering the compromises and adaptations required when building identification infrastructures. Furthermore, the activities of software vendors, often overlooked actors, are revealed as they distribute and reuse data matching systems, thereby influencing the long-term development of identification practices and infrastructures.

Significant findings from Chapter 6 arose by looking at the moments of interpretative flexibility and analyzing moments when the system demonstrated gateway-like characteristics. In short, moments of interpretative flexibility made it possible to retrace how a private company became enrolled in security logic through shifts in identification problems and solutions. The software was initially created as a versatile tool for data matching across industries and was only later tailored to meet specific needs like border security and migration management. At different points, the interpretative flexibility of data matching was closed down and reintroduced together with shifts in problematizations of data matching and identification. The design of the technology needed to address specific requirements and challenges of identification in border security and migration management as exemplified by the development of matching functions incorporating multicultural name matching and biometrics in response to new problematization of identifying known and suspected security threats. Additionally, focusing on these contingent moments made it apparent the role of diverse social groups, such as the development of international professional networks to secure contracts for developing identification systems.

Gateway moments offer a complementary approach to identify contingent moments in the long-term evolution of the data matching software by considering the intricate technical and logistical challenges of integrating different identification systems, which are not visible by only looking at shifts in interpretative flexibility. As such, the chapter provided insight into the contingent circulation of identity matching expertise among organizations. The integration of data matching system into IND systems showed the capacity to disseminate specific name matching functionalities across organizational boundaries. In contrast, such knowledge transfer does not invariably transpire, as seen in the use of the data matching system in the VIS Evolutions project, where factors like backward compatibility constraints limited the capacity for data matching knowledge to circulate. Methodologically, the multi-temporal sampling approach employing gateway moments as a heuristic unveils the contingency of the data matching system's integration into more extensive networks, revealing that the transfer of data matching knowledge relies on various elements. Gateway moments like the UMF and data model mapping elucidated that full data interoperability isn't always a prerequisite for data matching. Instead, the use of gateways was seen to offer adaptability and openness, potentially leading to contingent standardization. However, this standardization hinges on the specific choices made by organizations in terms of data mapping and adaptation to integrated systems.

Together, the moments of interpretative flexibility and gateway moments helped to demonstrate how data matching knowledge and expertise can circulate between different actors and organizations. These findings indicate how technologies and methods for matching identity data can spread and influence identification practices across various domains and settings.

## Discussion of theoretical and practical implications

This section discusses the theoretical implications of the research findings and how each chapter contributed to existing theoretical frameworks and concepts in its respective area of focus.

### Chapter 4

In Chapter 4, the introduction of the Ontology Explorer method and tool expands on methodological innovations in infrastructure studies and digital methods to analyze information systems for population management. The chapter highlights the potential for innovative methodological contributions in analyzing diverse organizations by examining the semantic level of information systems' data models. Methodologically, the chapter emphasizes the importance of finding correspondences between data models for data matching and integration, thus revealing the interconnections between technical details and the politics of knowledge production. This analysis enhances our understanding of the data models used in information systems and their role in revealing how authorities envision managing populations.

The chapter's practical and theoretical implications of the research findings are twofold. Firstly, the Ontology Explorer (OE) method introduces a means to account for resistance within information systems. Using the OE to analyze "thin" data models, researchers can identify differences and absences between systems, which can serve as the basis for critical analyses. This method allows for the detection of discrepancies between what is represented in the data models and the actual use of the systems, providing valuable insights into power dynamics and potential areas of intervention. Ethnographic observations can complement the findings from the OE, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of information systems.

Secondly, the OE method contributes to ongoing discussions on the politics of data and data-driven governance. While digital sociology often focuses on user-generated content, interventions into data need to examine existing structures, such as the underlying data models. The OE has the potential to present and analyze data models in unique ways, allowing for experimental forms of participation and speculation on alternate ways to represent data about populations. By engaging with the technicalities of information infrastructures rather than solely relying on textual content, the OE facilitates critical engagements with collected categories of data. This could open up opportunities for actors typically treated as data subjects to become active participants in rethinking and reshaping data practices, leading to more inclusive and transformative approaches to data governance.

Overall, Chapter 4 highlights the potential of the OE method to uncover resistance and power dynamics within information systems and to foster more participatory and reflexive approaches to data governance. By focusing on the technical aspects of data models, the method offers a distinctive perspective that complements traditional qualitative approaches, providing researchers and practitioners with valuable tools for critical analysis and intervention in the politics of data.

### Chapter 5

Chapter 5 extends existing discussions on identification by emphasizing the broader scope of what the chapter refers to as re-identification practices. While previous research has often focused on initial registration and biometric data, this chapter highlights other processes of retrieving and matching identity data across databases and deduplication. This chapter addresses an area not covered in existing literature -- the use of data matching technologies in routine bureaucratic re-identification. As such, the chapter's findings offer valuable insights into the dynamics of identification practices. These findings expand our theoretical understanding of identification beyond its initial stages and underscore the importance of considering the influence of data matching technologies in identity management.

Chapter 5 presents several practical implications that emerge from the study of re-identification practices and the use of data matching technologies at the IND. The chapter explores the practical utility of data matching technologies, which serve as effective tools to mitigate errors and ensure the precision of re-identification processes. On one hand, the effective utilization of these tools by organizations can result in a reduction of errors and an overall enhancement of the quality of identification data. Conversely, the emphasis on data matching in re-identification underscores the potential consequences of errors in data linkage or incorrect data entry into databases. Such errors can have adverse effects on individuals and organizations, necessitating additional efforts to verify and rectify inaccuracies.

Additionally, the integration of various systems can introduce friction and ambiguity into the search process. When users are required to query multiple systems equipped with distinct data matching engines, discrepancies in search behaviors and query formulations can emerge. To mitigate these issues, it would be advantageous for tools to take into account the search behaviors of other systems. This consideration could lead to the alignment of search processes or the implementation of an interface capable of translating and optimizing queries for multiple systems simultaneously. By facilitating this integration and alignment, the search process can be streamlined, reducing user confusion and ultimately enhancing the efficiency of re-identification efforts.

Furthermore, the separation of concerns and the modularization of components within identification systems exert a notable influence on search and match functionalities. In the context of the IND, these tools do not account for the contextual nuances of a search, such as the user's role or the stage of the identification process. However, the research findings have underscored the fact that users often possess distinct needs and preferences concerning search functionalities. For instance, certain users may necessitate more comprehensive information explaining why a specific match result was included in the search results. To accommodate these varied user requirements, the development of novel features in user applications aimed at assisting users in crafting queries and comprehending search outcomes could be advantageous. Moreover, fostering a more coherent integration between the backend search capabilities and the frontend user interface holds promise in enhancing both the user-friendliness and the overall capabilities of these search tools.

### Chapter 6

In Chapter 6, the theoretical implications are twofold. Firstly, the chapter offers an alternative to conventional longitudinal studies for exploring the complex processes shaped by and shaping identification systems and infrastructures. By proposing two multitemporal sampling heuristics—moments of interpretative flexibility and gateway moments—, the chapter demonstrates the use of considering the contingency in the development of sociotechnologies of identification. This contribution adds to the ongoing theoretical discourse, as exemplified by the Biography of Artefacts and Practices Approach [@pollockSoftwareOrganisationsBiography2009], regarding methods used to comprehend the development and use of software systems. Adopting a multi-temporal sampling approach in the field of IT in border and migration value broadens the analytical focus and opens up new avenues for inquiry. By adopting this approach, it is possible to gain a deeper understanding of the contingent sociotechnical processes involved in the development and evolution of identification technologies rather than simply viewing identification systems as a final product.

Secondly, the chapter further advances our comprehension of an often overlooked facet in the existing literature by delving into the development of data matching technology by a commercial software vendor. Employing heuristics to identify moments of contingency in the evolution of data matching software, the analysis effectively retraces the sociotechnical transformations of the software. It underscores instances where significant themes, such as internationalization, commercialization, securitization, and the infrastructuring of identification, have become apparent in this context. Consequently, this chapter's insights contributes to the body of knowledge surrounding the involvement of non-state, commercial entities in the datafication of migration and border control.

Chapter 6 offers practical implications stemming from its exploration of the interpretative flexibility heuristic. This heuristic underscores the inherently dynamic nature of identification technologies and practices, challenging the notion that these technologies possess fixed or stable meanings. Instead, it accentuates how various social groups actively engage in the interpretation and contestation of these technologies. This social agency, in turn, exerts a significant influence on the trajectory and outcomes of identification technologies and practices. Recognizing the concept of interpretative flexibility invites rethinking these systems in a way that is more responsive to the diverse and evolving needs of the individuals and communities they affect.

The concept of gateway moments provides practical insights into the expansions of identification systems into more extensive infrastructures. It underscores the critical role of data matching technologies as connectors, bridging gaps and enabling the seamless integration of heterogeneous identification systems and practices. These gateway-like technologies, although sometimes underestimated, serve as crucial facilitators in establishing and maintaining networks within larger-scale infrastructures. Recognizing the significance of these gateways can inform the design and implementation of identification systems.  Acknowledging the role of these gateways can pave the way for more robust and effective identification infrastructures, benefiting the individuals and organizations that rely on them.

<!-- This section discusses the theoretical and practical implications of the dissertation's findings and how they advance our understanding of identification technologies, infrastructures, and societal implications. The theoretical implications highlight the methodological innovations and the importance of considering data models, resistance, and the politics of data in analyzing information systems. Other findings deepen our theoretical understanding of the intricate between technical aspects and the broader socio-political context of identification practices in shaping and being shaped by transnational commercialized security infrastructures. On the practical side, the implications brought out the challenges and opportunities in re-identification processes, the integration of search and match tools, and the role of gateway technologies in bridging data systems. These practical implications can potentially inform identification system design, implementation, and improvement, ultimately contributing to more effective and accountable data matching and identification technologies. -->

The next section will reflect on the research process and discuss limitations encountered during the study. It will provide an opportunity to evaluate the methodology, data collection, and analysis techniques, discussing their strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, the section will address constraints or challenges faced throughout the research, such as data access limitations or the generalizability of findings. By reflecting on the research process and its inherent limitations, the dissertation aims to produce recommendations for future studies on identification technologies and transnational commercialized security infrastructures.

## Overview of the research process

The research process was guided by a methodological framework that leveraged data matching as both a subject of investigation and a research resource. Drawing inspiration from Bowker and Star's notion of "infrastructural inversions," three distinct methodological strategies were employed: comparing data models, analyzing data practices, and tracing sociotechnical change. These strategies were integrated into a methodological framework, allowing for a comprehensive examination of the practices and technologies involved in matching identity data. By reversing the tendency of infrastructure to recede into the background, this methodological framework made it possible to uncover the different aspects of matching identity data.

The first inversion strategy employed was the comparison of data models, which provided insights into the information collected by various authorities' information systems for population management. This work included collecting data models from EU and EU Member State authorities through desk research. Other researchers' contributions from the Processing Citizenship project also provided indirect traces of data models, such as screenshots of graphical user interfaces that provided evidence of categories of data collected in systems. Utilizing indirect traces of data models emerged as a strategic approach to tackle the challenges associated with obtaining data models for systems operating in the sensitive realm of migration and border control. In this context, where technical specifications related to data models are typically not publicly accessible, the indirect traces served as a valuable alternative. However, this approach introduced an additional layer of complexity. It necessitated the development of methods to effectively compare various documents pertaining to data models, a task made more intricate by the diverse file formats and languages in which these documents were presented. Addressing this multidimensional challenge was imperative to ensure the success of the data model comparison and analysis process.

Therefore, the introduced Ontology Explorer method dealt directly with those challenges. It successfully enabled us to compare diverse data models by employing additional steps to code, harmonize, and group all documents, categories, and values. The novelty came from integrating insights from existing classification and infrastructure studies and discourse analysis into a systematic method for analyzing data models. Additionally, drawing from an analysis of data models using the OE, @pelizzaScriptsAlterityMapping2023 built further on this work. This 2023 article described the different "scripts of alterity" of security subjects, highlighting how data infrastructures shape power dynamics among individuals and states. Furthermore, the OE tool used for this research has been released as open-source software [@vanrossemOntologyexplorer2021], enabling the analysis of information systems' data models in various domains and contexts beyond this research's scope.

The second infrastructural inversion strategy delved into the analysis of data practices, aiming to unveil the intricacies of routine activities involved in searching for and matching identity data within diverse organizational contexts. To operationalize this strategy data, fieldwork and interviews were conducted at a software supplier specializing in commercial data matching tools and at one of the company's customers, namely the Netherlands' Immigration and Naturalization Service (IND). The fieldwork involved a series of meetings and interviews with the company's personnel, which took place online and on-site at their headquarters in Utrecht, The Netherlands. Additionally, documentation was provided to me to facilitate an in-depth exploration of the technical intricacies underpinning the design of the data matching software. This approach enabled a thorough exploration of the data practices embedded within these organizations and their implications in the context of identity matching.

The initial project proposal was initially conceived to undertake a comprehensive analysis and comparison of the utilization of the company's data matching software at both the IND and the EU Visa Information System (EU-VIS). This approach was rooted in the anticipation of encountering distinct challenges and dynamics due to the differing scales of usage at these two entities. However, as the research progressed, it became evident that certain adaptations were necessary. Access to the IND proved to be more readily available, while the complexities surrounding confidentiality and access hindered extensive research regarding the EU-VIS project. Consequently, the research focus was redirected towards a more in-depth exploration of the software's practical application within the IND. This shift in approach was embraced by all parties involved, as it offered mutual benefits. The software company gained valuable insights into the real-world utilization of their product, while the IND agency had the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the intricacies and challenges associated with the search and match functionalities.

I conducted semi-structured interviews with the IND agency staff members to understand their day-to-day activities concerning data searching and identity matching in identifying applicants throughout the agency's complex bureaucratic procedures. Detailed descriptions of the interview process and the subsequent data analysis can be found in Chapter 3 and Chapter 5 of this dissertation. Following the interview phase, I compiled a report summarizing my findings, which was then shared with the software company and the IND agency. The responses I received from both parties were notably positive, with an invitation extended for me to present the report at a company-wide online meeting dedicated to disseminating knowledge and insights. It is worth highlighting that the research provided valuable insights into the actual usage of the company's software. This aspect is particularly noteworthy given that the company functions as a software supplier, often deploying its products through various organizations. It frequently lacks comprehensive visibility into the end-users' interactions with their software solutions.

The third infrastructural inversion strategy focused on mapping the dynamics of sociotechnical change, exploring the dissemination of knowledge, technologies, and practices associated with data matching across organizations and over extended periods. This approach arose as an adaptation to the constraints encountered during the research, which initially aimed to analyze and compare the use of data matching technology in the IND and EU-VIS systems. The modified strategy delved into the historical progression of the software, unveiling the sociotechnical networks that played a role in the transnational circulation of identification technologies. The research explored the rapid growth of commercial solutions within the identification technology domain and illuminated the interplay between data matching and shifting problematizations of identification. To illustrate, I delved into the company's involvement in an international competition sponsored by a prominent US research organization. This competition sought innovative name matching solutions, and by retracing the various parties involved, I unearthed connections between technological advancements, market dynamics, and the imperative need for security measures. This exploration facilitated a comprehensive understanding of how data matching solutions have continuously evolved to address changing problems.

This research phase was also grounded in fieldwork and interviews conducted at the same software supplier, a creator of commercial data matching tools. Here, the central objective was to delve into the transformations within data matching and transnational data infrastructures, seeking to unveil contingencies in these systems' historical development and evolution. The interviewees were generally keen to share their experiences, expressing interest in contemplating broader issues beyond their immediate organizational roles. Nevertheless, some aspects of the early evolutions of the company remained obscure, often due to interviewees' lack of direct involvement during that period. To address this gap, I complemented the interviews with information from archival sources such as dated web pages, news articles, and press releases. This multifaceted approach allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter by cross-referencing and triangulating the information, revealing valuable insights into the transformations, adaptations, and challenges.

This section has provided an overview of the research process employed in this study. Using the methodological framework inspired by "infrastructural inversions," the research explored data matching as both a research topic and a resource. Three methodological strategies were used, including comparing data models, analyzing data practices, and tracing sociotechnical change. These strategies enabled examining the interplay between identification systems and the internationalization, commercialization, and securitization of identification. Through data collection methods such as desk research, fieldwork, and interviews, the research developed new perspectives on the information collected by organizations, the everyday data practices of matching identity data and re-identification, and the dynamics of transnational commercialized security infrastructures. The next section will further reflect on the findings, including unexpected discoveries and the limitations and challenges faced during the research.

## Reflection on findings and limitations

While conducting research, I discovered some surprising findings that indicate how a company's software is integrated affects how customers use it for data matching and identity management. Specifically, these findings challenged my assumptions about the data matching tools, as the software's integration in systems such as the Netherlands' migration and asylum was relatively invisible to users. Also, I was surprised to discover that the software was adaptable and effective across different domains, which challenges traditional notions about the difficulty of adapting generic software to local circumstances. However, throughout the research, several limitations also arose that had a direct impact on the findings I was able to produce. In this section, I will examine the unexpected results, discuss the identified limitations, and reflect on the research outcomes.

### Surprising and unexpected findings

Several surprising and unexpected findings emerged from Chapter 4 that aided our analysis of data categories within systems and their implications. One striking revelation was the substantial divergence in the categories of data present across different systems, such as regarding the specificity of information related to individuals' names. For example, data categories concerning previous names or aliases or a date category to indicate whether someone was considered violent within specific data models showcased how these categories could indicate authorities' conceptions and imaginaries about individuals. Furthermore, the analysis showed that only a limited number of shared data categories, such as birth date, nationality, and biometric data, were consistently used among the multiple systems. These findings showed how identity data categories, seemingly technical details, help examine authorities' imaginaries about people on the move.

Chapter 5 presented unexpected insights regarding the integration of WCC company's data matching software into the Immigration and Naturalization Service (IND) systems. Notably, the software's design, which positioned it as a relatively independent component within the IND systems, created a unique set of challenges. While this approach was efficient in some respects, it did not always align with the specific needs of all users. One significant consequence of this design was the relative invisibility of the search process to most users, resulting in a lack of awareness regarding the underlying data matching mechanisms. The chapter's exploration of diverse data matching scenarios within the IND underscores the potential benefits of tighter integration between the software, the local context, and the system's graphical user interface. For instance, during interviews, it became evident that users often required clarification when search results included matches based on historical data, such as matching previous names before marriage. This finding emphasises the importance of enhancing the user experience to ensure a clear understanding of search results and the seamless use of the data matching software.

Chapter 6 revealed unexpected findings concerning the role of commercial software companies within the domain of identification. The research investigated the dynamics between the software company as a technology supplier and its associations with technology integrators, unearthing intricate professional networks focused on identification solutions. Surprisingly, these relationships impacted the company's positioning in the market and led to its foray into new realms of identity and security. An additional surprising finding pertained to the circulation of data matching knowledge; contrary to initial expectations, the adaptable design of the data matching software allowed for customization to meet customers' specific requirements. This means that the expertise in data matching within the software was not always utilized and circulated between organizations. Overall, Chapter 6's examination challenged the conventional view of the company's data matching software as a fixed solution for identity matching in migration, border control, and security, unveiling the diverse contingencies shaping the software's evolution.

### Limitations

During this research, several limitations were encountered that are essential to grasp to understand the scope and implications of the study. These limitations impacted the breadth and depth of the investigation, making it necessary to consider them when interpreting the research findings.

As part of the Processing Citizenship project, the initial plan, in collaboration with the Principal Investigator, was to set up my fieldwork within the eu-LISA EU agency to investigate identity data and data quality in the context of border security and migration management. However, this endeavour proved challenging due to significant access restrictions and the customary barriers encountered in qualitative secrecy research. Regrettably, we could not secure access to commence the proposed project at the designated fieldwork location, resulting in significant time and effort expended in cultivating contacts and formulating a comprehensive project proposal for a potential traineeship with the agency. Ultimately, the primary stumbling block pertained to disagreements over the ownership and utilization of the research data that would be generated. Consequently, we decided to establish new fieldwork research by collaborating with a data matching technology supplier for the agency.[^positionality]

[^positionality]: As the researcher conducting this study, I believe that my background played a meaningful role in assisting me access the fieldwork. Being a white male with an academic background in computer science and experience in software development, I was able to speak the same language as my interlocutors, which facilitated communication and ensured better understanding of their perspectives. Moreover, my knowledge of Dutch and being based in the Netherlands helped to establish trustworthiness with the participants. It is worth mentioning that the research was conducted under the EU funded project Processing Citizenship, which added to its credibility and relevance.

The company swiftly accepted the project proposal in Dec 2019--Jan 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic introduced unexpected challenges to the research project with the data matching software company. Initially, the research had to be postponed due to COVID-19-related safety measures and travel restrictions in the Netherlands. When restrictions were eventually eased, my on-site visits to the company were impacted by fewer employees on-site, as limitations were imposed on the number of individuals allowed to work in the office, with many staff members continuing to work remotely. Subsequently, with the reintroduction of restrictions, I could not visit the company on-site. Consequently, the research had to adapt to an online format, reducing opportunities for in-person visits and direct observations during fieldwork. This shift away from face-to-face interactions and direct observations potentially curtailed the depth of insight into the intricacies and ramifications of software usage.

The study had limitations due to the decision to concentrate on the EU Visa Information System and the Netherlands 'migration and asylum agency systems rather than investigating the company's developments in advanced passenger information systems. This decision aligned with the broader goals of the Processing Citizenship project, but it restricted the inquiry to specific projects in the company's portfolio; some other relevant customers would also have necessitated security clearances. Additionally, obtaining relevant documentation about the use of data matching software in the EU-VIS system proved to be challenging due to the company's limited access to EU documentation and confidentiality practices by the technology integrator, which hindered my ability to delve deeply into the intricacies of software implementation and its influence on identity data management within the EU context. Indeed, the research in Chapter 5 focused on the implementation within The Netherlands' immigration and asylum agency, with access to this specific context's technical details. In contrast, Chapter 6 shifted its focus towards exploring connections with EU-VIS and the broader transnational security infrastructures by tracing the software's sociotechnical evolution, drawing from different accessible data sources.

Despite the encountered limitations, this study undoubtedly contributes to our comprehension of how the integration of commercial identification software shapes and is shaped by transnational security infrastructures. Recognizing these limitations also serves to highlight the complexities inherent in researching technology within the realm of security, including issues related to access and secrecy. Moreover, it emphasizes the significance of being attuned to the contingencies and unforeseen developments that can unfold in research. Significantly, the shift towards collaborating with a less widely known data matching software supplier unveiled previously lesser-kown dimensions of identification and identity management. The subsequent section will delve into the ethical considerations that arose throughout this collaboration and research process.

## Ethical considerations

Collaborating with a company in identity data and security inevitably prompted ethical considerations that revolved around the potential repercussions of their technology on individuals. These concerns extended to pondering how the findings and insights derived from the research might influence the company's ongoing development of its software solutions. The research's dual role, offering an in-depth analysis of the software's functionalities while simultaneously assisting the company in refining its technology, necessitated reflecting on the parties involved, including the company, the individuals impacted by the technology, and the broader societal implications of data matching in the securitization of migration and border control.

During my interviews with Immigration and Naturalization Service (IND) personnel, I observed the potential advantages of data matching in streamlining bureaucratic processes, benefiting both employees and applicants. The implementation of data matching technology assisted in the execution of daily tasks, offering support in various aspects of their work. However, my observations also revealed that particular system design choices could unintentionally impede efficient operations. For instance, I observed that there was no automatic check to determine whether an applicant existed within the agency's database. This seemingly minor technical oversight sometimes led to the creation of duplicate data entries, subsequently necessitating additional efforts to resolve these duplicates at a later stage. Nevertheless, rectifying this issue is not straightforward, as it requires a clear and reliable definition of what constitutes a duplicate record. Additionally, duplicate entries could raise suspicions of fraudulent activities on the part of applicants. These issues can often stem from previous data entry errors rather than malicious intent, underscoring the complexities of data matching in sensitive contexts like migration and identity management.

Chapter 6 has underscored ethical considerations pertaining to the development of data matching software. This chapter delved into the incorporation of name matching functionalities within the software, notably in its utilization of name databases. These databases encompass a wide array of names, including those of Arabic and Asian origin. The development of name matching expertise and technology, influenced by linguistic and transliteration differences, raises the potential for names from these groups to be disproportionately flagged as potential matches. Such overrepresentation within flagged categories can perpetuate stereotypes and further marginalize specific individuals. It is paramount to evaluate such technological solutions to discern their potential consequences and unintended effects. Unfortunately, these systems often operate as opaque "black boxes" obscured from public scrutiny, a concern that may be exacerbated when commercial entities with proprietary technologies become involved.

## Future research directions

There are several areas that require further research to fill the knowledge gaps, anticipate emerging technological developments, advance methodologies, encourage interdisciplinary collaborations, and explore practical applications of data matching and other identification technologies in transnational commercialized security infrastructures.

Chapter 4 highlighted the potential of alternative methods and tools for analyzing identification systems, which warrants further research. To advance this exploration, it is suggested that future studies investigate the intricacies of identification systems, which can be facilitated by using methods like the combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches employed in this dissertation to analyze data models. Interdisciplinary collaboration across various fields was essential to develop the Ontology Explorer (OE) method and tool. Future research should actively promote collaborations that engage researchers from diverse domains, including computer science, sociology, law, ethics, and policy, as this can yield multifaceted perspectives and novel insights. As developed and applied in this dissertation, the OE method and tool have been instrumental in analyzing the commonalities and distinctions among various data models. Future research could analyze the mechanisms that hinder or facilitate data interoperability, enhancing our understanding of how data models affect identification in transnational infrastructures.

Chapter 5 examined the interplay between data matching technologies and re-identification processes, revealing both the potential benefits and challenges of these technologies. Future research can delve deeper into the evolving landscape of data matching and linking, particularly considering the influence of emerging technologies like generative artificial intelligence and biometrics on identification. For instance, AI-driven data matching systems can present unique challenges for individuals who may be falsely identified, as explaining and comprehending these matches can be complex, potentially hindering the dispute of false positive results. The seamless integration of these emerging technologies can impact re-identification processes substantially. As we move forward, it is imperative to scrutinize the potential benefits and associated risks of these technologies, all while considering ethical and policy implications. Establishing robust governance mechanisms is essential to safeguard individual rights and ensure accountability and transparency.

Chapter 6 has provided a comprehensive exploration of the evolution of a data matching system, underscoring its inherent contingency and the diverse array of actors that have played pivotal roles in shaping its development. Future research endeavours should continue to delve into the practical applications of identification systems and their real-world utilization. This bridging of academic theories with practical experiences can illuminate the intricacies of how specific identification technologies function across various domains, ranging from healthcare and finance to public administration. Collaborative efforts across multiple disciplines become crucial, as experts from diverse fields can significantly contribute to understanding identification systems.

## Final reflections and concluding remarks

This dissertation embarked on a journey driven by an initial curiosity about the interplay between data matching and linking processes and the blind spots faced by authorities. It aimed to decipher how authorities navigate the complexities of identifying individuals even when faced with incomplete data, aliases, and false identities. This dissertation initiated this journey by mapping the theoretical landscape to untangling the intricacies of matching identity data in the domain of transnational commercialized security infrastructures, thus laying the foundation for the research questions. Furthermore, it introduced a methodological framework to not only examine data matching but also harness data matching as a research resource, opening new avenues for investigating the challenges posed by identification processes across national borders, notably in the context of border security and migration control.

First, introducing a novel method and tool in this study facilitated a comprehensive exploration of the differences and commonalities embedded in data models of national and transnational security infrastructures, shedding light on the varying knowledge and assumptions about individuals on the move. Within the categories of data found in these models, one can discern authorities' imaginaries, revealing how they conceptualize and enact individuals in distinct ways. This conceptualization also influences the realm of data matching, as the integration and interoperability of data hinge on the connections between these data models, playing a pivotal role in matching individuals' data across diverse data sources.

Secondly, the focus on data matching has moved attention beyond initial registration and identification phases to re-identification practices across data infrastructures. Re-identification was introduced as a concept that entails the continuous utilization and interconnection of data from diverse sources to determine if multiple sets of identity data correspond to a singular real-world individual. However, examining the iterative processes of re-identifying applicants throughout different stages of bureaucratic procedures highlighted that while integrating data matching tools for re-identification can mitigate friction in re-identification, it can also introduce certain associated costs.

Thirdly, tracing the sociotechnical changes of a data matching system has allowed us to detect the circulation of knowledge, technologies, and practices involved in data matching over time and across various organizations. The data matching system's use in identification for migration and border control was shown as not predetermined. Instead, we found that the system's securitization was influenced by specific choices made by key actors and the changing sociotechnical landscape of identification and data matching. Through this analysis, we have unveiled unexpected connections between software suppliers and their customers, shedding light on the intricate networks that underlie identification infrastructures. These findings challenge simplistic narratives and underscore the necessity of adopting a more performative understanding of the sociotechnical dynamics that shape identification practices. By emphasizing contingency in the system's evolution, we spotlighted moments where the outcomes in development are not predetermined but rather influenced by the specific circumstances, factors, and decisions made by the individuals and entities involved, thereby expanding our comprehension of the processes underpinning identification technologies' development.

In conclusion, this dissertation has sought to unravel the intricate dynamics of practices and technologies for matching identity data in the complex domains of migration management and border control, elucidating how these processes both influence and are influenced by the broader, transnational commercialized security infrastructures. This dissertation's performative approach to data matching has underscored that the intersection of identification technologies, data matching, and securitization is far from deterministic or linear. Instead, it is shaped by contingent choices and sociotechnical dynamics, emphasizing that alternative courses of action have been and continue to be possible. In this ever-evolving landscape, the actors involved play a pivotal role in shaping the direction of identification technologies, ultimately influencing the complex interplay of identity, security, and migration in our contemporary world. As we navigate an era where borders, identities, and security become increasingly intertwined, this research encourages us to remain critical, adaptable, and open to multidisciplinary collaborations.
