This concluding chapter attempts to synthesize the dissertation's research into the practices and technologies of matching identity data within migration management and border control, focusing on the influence of transnational commercialized security infrastructures. Throughout the dissertation, we explored the practices and technologies of matching identity data, aiming to understand the types of knowledge and assumptions inscribed in data models, the technologies organizations use to search and match identity data, and the circulation of data matching knowledge and technology across organizations. This chapter summarizes the main findings, interprets their significance, discusses their theoretical and practical implications, reflects on the research process, and outlines future research directions.

## Restatement of the main research question and summary of the research

The primary focus of this dissertation was to investigate the practices and technologies for matching identity data in data infrastructure for migration management and border control. The research sought to understand the interplay between data infrastructures, identification systems, and transnational security to understand the internationalization, commercialization, and securitization of identification through the materiality and performativity of data matching practices and technologies. By examining this interplay, the dissertation aimed to uncover the implications for individuals, organizations, and broader transnational security contexts. Specifically, the dissertation addressed the following overarching research question:

> How are practices and technologies for matching identity data in migration management and border control shaping and shaped by transnational commercialized security infrastructures?

Through this research question, the dissertation sought to contribute to a more performative understanding of the role of data matching technology and its impact on the meaning of data, practices, and the organizations that employ it. To achieve this goal, we identified several specific research objectives. Firstly, we mapped the theoretical landscape related to internationalization, securitization, and infrastructuring of identification, deriving the research question that guided our investigation into data matching in transnational data infrastructures (Chapter 2). Subsequently, we developed a comprehensive methodological framework to analyze data matching practices and technologies within transnational infrastructures, focusing on uncovering embedded technical details through different infrastructural inversion strategies (Chapter 3).

Next, we introduced a novel method and software tool designed to analyze the underlying schemas of information systems in population management. This approach gave us insights into authorities' imaginaries about people on the move and the corresponding intricacies of data interoperability and matching (Chapter 4). We also examined the relationship between identity data matching technologies and routine identification practices, shedding light on the practical implications and challenges organizations encounter when trying to match identity data to re-identify individuals (Chapter 5). Lastly, we investigated the long-term development of identification systems and the establishment of transnational data infrastructures. By identifying crucial moments in the lifecycle of commercial data matching software, we explored how data matching expertise travels and circulates, ultimately influencing the practices and technologies employed in transnational security infrastructures (Chapter 6).

The following section will proceed with a summary of the Chapters' findings, delving deeper into their implications and providing an overview of the key themes and insights that emerged from the research.

## Overview of the findings

This section highlights and interprets some key findings from the empirical investigations conducted in this dissertation. The presented findings highlight the interplay between practices, technologies, and transnational security infrastructures within the context of matching identity data in migration management and border control.

### Chapter 4: "The Ontology Explorer: A method to make visible data infrastructures for population management

Chapter 4 contributes to the research objective of introducing a new method and software tool to analyze the schemas underpinning information systems in population management. The "Ontology Explorer" (OE) methodology and tool fulfil this objective by enabling a systematic examination and comparison of non-homogeneous data models used in diverse information systems. By employing the OE, which draws inspiration from schema matching techniques and STS research on classifications and standards, the chapter uncovers the less visible assumptions embedded within the data models of information systems for population management.

The infrastructural inversion strategy employed in Chapter 4 compared data models to uncover authorities' imaginaries and expectations about people on the move embedded within the technical standards of data infrastructures. Chapter 4 thus addresses research question 1 (_Which types of knowledge and assumptions about people-on-the-move are inscribed in data models of national and transnational security infrastructures? What implications does this have for how organizations can search and match identity data?_), through an illustrative analysis of the types of knowledge and assumptions about people-on-the-move inscribed in data models of national and transnational authorities. The illustrative analysis demonstrated how the OE can be used to make visible the implicit knowledge and assumptions in data infrastructures for population management. It sheds light on the conceptualization of identity data among authorities involved in population management and the potential implications for searching and matching such data.

As such, Chapter 4 indirectly contributes to the main research question by elucidating the reciprocal relationship between practices, technologies, and transnational commercialized security infrastructures. Through applying the OE methodology, the chapter introduces a new method and tool and illustrates its use to make the less visible assumptions and patterns embedded within information systems visible. As such, it provides insights into how identity data properties can influence the creation and circulation of data and the relationships between different authorities' data models. Such insights can enhance our understanding of identity data matching within transnational security infrastructures.

### Chapter 5: "From registration to re-identification: Exploring the interplay of data matching software in routine identification practices,"

Chapter 5 investigated the relationship between identity data matching technologies and routine identification practices within migration management. The findings from this chapter provide valuable insights into the complexities of identification practices mediated by data matching software technology. The chapter primarily employs the infrastructural inversion strategy of data practices to examine the influence of identity data matching technologies on routine identification practices. By delving into the behind-the-scenes practices of searching, matching, and linking identity data in data infrastructures, the chapter sheds light on how these sociotechnical practices shape, transform, and stabilize identification processes.

Chapter 5 addresses Research Question 2 (_How do organizations that collect information about people-on-the-move search and match for identity data in their systems? How is data about people-on-the-move matched and linked across different agencies and organizations?_) to explore how organizations collecting information about people-on-the-move search for and match identity data in their systems, as well as how data about such individuals is matched and linked across different agencies and organizations. Through empirical investigation, the chapter focuses on the case of a Dutch government migration and asylum agency and its utilization of a data matching software package. The chapter introduces re-identification to capture various iterative identification processes, such as retrieving someone's corresponding identity data in databases or determining if multiple database records (possibly from different organizations) reference the same real-world person. The findings reveal four significant influences of the software package on the agency's bureaucratic re-identification practices.

A first influence is the software's design, which incorporates expectations of uncertainty during database searches to account for potential errors in search queries and database records. Based on fuzzy search algorithms and probability-based ranking of matches, this design mediates all client searches, whether performed by humans or automated systems. As such, this finding underscores the role of the software in shaping the agency's re-identification practices by accommodating the inherent uncertainties in identity data. Secondly, the software package influences re-identification practices by assembling knowledge about identity data, facilitating equivalences between disparate practices. By replacing and enhancing the IND agency personnel's knowledge of identity data and re-identification, the findings show the software's potential to redistribute identification skills and knowledge within the agency, impacting routine identification practices.

The materiality of identity data emerges as a third influence on bureaucratic re-identification practices. The use of the software package was primarily related to the searching and matching of alphanumeric identity data, as compared to biometric identity. The findings suggest that the shape and nature of identity data, such as alphanumeric/biographical data versus biometric data, intrinsically impact the strategies and constraints involved in re-identification processes. In short, the materialities of more loosely defined biographic data versus more strictly defined biometric data facilitate and constrain bureaucratic re-identification in different ways.

The fourth influence is based on how the architecture of the system-level bureaucratic INDiGO system shapes re-identification practices. The service-oriented architecture, with its separation of the searching and matching functionality from other system components, offers benefits in terms of efficiency and maintenance. However, the drawback is the system's limited consideration of the context in which searches are performed, potentially limiting its effectiveness in specific scenarios. The current software architecture may have the unintended consequence of treating all users (IND staff from various units and automated systems) as passive participants with little understanding of re-identification's social and material circumstances.

In summary, Chapter 5's findings contribute to discussions on the materiality and performativity of identification. Firstly, the findings shed light on lesser-known practices and technologies for re-identifying people across data infrastructures, highlighting the interplay between data matching software and routine identification practices. Secondly, the findings reveal how data matching technologies and bureaucratic information systems have shaped routine bureaucratic re-identification, emphasizing the reciprocal influence between practices and technologies within migration management.

### Chapter 6: "Uncovering the long-term development of identification infrastructures: A multi-temporal perspective"

Chapter 6 delved into the evolution of identification systems and the construction of transnational security infrastructures. The findings contribute to the research objective of exploring the lifecycle of identification systems, identifying pivotal moments, and examining how data matching expertise circulates among various actors and organizations. This chapter delves into the growth of identification systems and transnational data infrastructures over time. It mainly tracks the progress of a commercial data matching software package and examines the various procedures and factors that influenced the software's development, as well as the organizations involved in its creation and utilization. By identifying pivotal moments and examining the changing interpretive flexibility of the software, the chapter provides insights into actors' problematizations of identification and the compromises necessary when integrating identification systems into broader infrastructures.

The chapter analyzed the evolution of technology and design over time by taking a longitudinal perspective and adopting the infrastructural inversion strategy of sociotechnical change. The chapter proposes two heuristical devices to identify pivotal moments: first, the changing interpretive flexibility of the software package and second, the gateway moments when identification systems intersect with broader infrastructures. These two heuristics were applied to analyzing a commercial data matching software package's empirical case to reveal the complex interactions between technology suppliers and organizations, offering valuable insights into identification systems and infrastructures dynamics.

In this way, the chapter addresses Research Question 3 (_How does knowledge and technology for matching identity data circulate and travel across organizations?_) by exploring the networks, actors, and organizations involved in developing and disseminating data matching technologies. Concerning the main research question, the chapter's analysis illuminates the intricate relationship between identification practices, technologies, and transnational commercialized security infrastructures. The chapter offers insights into how globally honed technologies are adjusted to new contexts by uncovering the compromises and adaptations required when building identification infrastructures. Furthermore, the activities of software vendors, often overlooked actors, are revealed as they distribute and reuse software packages, thereby influencing the long-term development of identification practices and infrastructures.

Significant findings from Chapter 6 arose by looking at the moments of interpretative flexibility and analyzing moments when the software package demonstrated gateway-like characteristics. In short, moments of interpretative flexibility provided insights into how a private company became enrolled in security logic through shifts in identification problems and solutions. While the software was initially conceived as a generic solution applicable across various domains, its interpretative flexibility came into play when the problem was redefined in the context of border security and migration management. The design of the technology closed down to address specific requirements and challenges of identification in border security and migration management. The implementation of new name matching functions has emphasized the growing emphasis on identifying possible security risks by using multicultural name matching and biometrics. Additionally, it was possible to see the formation of networks aimed at securing contracts to develop identification systems for different states.

Additionally, the chapter uncovered the role of gateway technologies in bridging heterogeneous data systems and practices, acting as crucial components in establishing and maintaining networks within larger-scale infrastructures. The gateway framing sheds light on the intricate technical and logistical challenges involved in integrating different identification systems, highlighting the significance of ELISE as a crucial component in harmonizing and facilitating communication within the broader identification infrastructure. By conceptualizing ELISE as a reusable gateway system that effectively transports identification expertise across organizations through its identity- and name-matching features, we better understand the data matching knowledge and expertise that circulates between different actors and organizations. The findings underscore how technologies and practices for matching identity data circulate and influence identification practices in different domains and settings.

## Discussion of theoretical and practical implications

This section discusses the theoretical implications of the research findings and how each chapter contributed to existing theoretical frameworks and concepts in its respective area of focus.

### Chapter 4

In Chapter 4, the introduction of the Ontology Explorer method and tool expands the methodological innovations in infrastructure studies and digital methods for population management. The chapter highlights the potential for innovative methodological contributions in analyzing such complex systems by examining the semantic level of information systems' data models. Methodologically, the chapter emphasizes the importance of finding correspondences between data models for data matching and integration, thus revealing the interconnections between technical details and the politics of knowledge production. This contribution adds depth to the theoretical understanding of information systems and their role in population management.

In Chapter 4, the practical and theoretical implications of the research findings are twofold. Firstly, the Ontology Explorer (OE) method introduces a means to account for resistance within information systems. Using the OE to analyze "thin" data models, researchers can identify differences and absences between systems, which can serve as the basis for critical analyses. This method allows for the detection of discrepancies between what is represented in the data models and the actual use of the systems, providing valuable insights into power dynamics and potential areas of intervention. Ethnographic observations can complement the findings from the OE, leading to a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of information systems.

Secondly, the OE method contributes to ongoing discussions on the politics of data and data-driven governance. While digital sociology often focuses on user-generated content, interventions into data need to examine existing structures, such as the underlying data models. The OE offers a means to present and analyze data models more comprehensibly, enabling experimental forms of participation and speculation. By engaging with the technicalities of information infrastructures rather than solely relying on textual content, the OE facilitates critical engagements with collected categories of data. This could open up opportunities for actors typically treated as data subjects to become active participants in rethinking and reshaping data practices, leading to more inclusive and transformative approaches to data governance.

Overall, Chapter 4 highlights the potential of the OE method to uncover resistance and power dynamics within information systems and to foster more participatory and reflexive approaches to data governance. By focusing on the technical aspects of data models, the method offers a unique perspective that complements traditional qualitative approaches, providing researchers and practitioners with valuable tools for critical analysis and intervention in the politics of data.

### Chapter 5

Chapter 5 extends existing discussions on identification by emphasizing the broader scope of what the chapter refers to as re-identification practices. While previous research has often focused on initial registration and biometric data, this chapter highlights the significance of retrieving and matching identity data across databases and deduplication processes. The chapter fills a gap in the literature by exploring the role of data matching technologies in routine bureaucratic re-identification. The chapter's findings offer valuable insights into the dynamics of identification practices. This expands our theoretical understanding of identification beyond its initial stages and underscores the importance of considering the influence of data matching technologies in identity management.

Chapter 5 presents several practical implications that emerge from the study of re-identification practices and the use of search and match tools. These implications highlight the importance of data matching technology in identification systems. Firstly, the focus on re-identification draws attention to the potential consequences of data linking errors or incorrect data insertion in databases. Such errors can negatively impact individuals and organizations, leading to the need for "repair work" to rectify the mistakes. The search and match tools discussed in the chapter often serve as powerful tools to help users avoid such mistakes and ensure the accuracy of re-identification processes. By utilizing these tools more effectively, organizations can reduce errors and enhance the overall quality of identification data.

Secondly, the integration of identification systems with other databases or architectural components can introduce friction and confusion in the search process. Users often need to query multiple systems with different search and match engines, which can create discrepancies in search behaviours and query formulations. To address such problems, it would be beneficial for tools to consider the search behaviours of other systems and align them or provide an interface that can simultaneously translate and optimize queries for multiple systems. This integration and alignment would streamline the search process and reduce user confusion, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of re-identification practices.

Thirdly, the separation of concerns and modularization of components in identification systems impact the search and match functionalities. Currently, the tools do not consider the context of a search, such as the user or the stage of the identification process. However, the findings indicated that users often have different needs and preferences regarding search functionalities. For instance, some users required more information on why a particular match result was included in the search results. In order to meet the different needs of users, it may be helpful to create new features in user applications that can help users create queries and understand search results. A more coherent integration between the backend search and the frontend user interface would also enhance the ease of use and maximize the capabilities of the search tools.

### Chapter 6

In Chapter 6, the theoretical implications are twofold. Firstly, the chapter addresses methodological concerns by highlighting the impact of researchers' methodological decisions on the findings. By proposing two multitemporal sampling heuristics—moments of interpretative flexibility and gateway moments—, the chapter demonstrates the importance of considering the temporal dimension when studying sociotechnologies of identification. This contribution advances the theoretical discourse on methodological approaches in understanding the evolution of identification technologies over time.

Secondly, the chapter sheds light on the sociotechnical processes of commercialization and securitization of identification technology. The chapter reveals the complex interplay between technology, actors, and broader sociotechnical contexts by examining the empirical case of a vendor's development of a data matching technology. This analysis provides valuable insights into the commercialization and securitization of identification technologies, contributing to our theoretical understanding of how these technologies shape and are shaped by transnational commercialized security infrastructures. Overall, the theoretical implications of the research findings extend existing frameworks, address methodological gaps, and provide nuanced insights into the complexities of population management, identification systems, and transnational data infrastructures. The contributions made by each chapter deepen our understanding of these areas and open avenues for further theoretical exploration and development.

Chapter 6 presents several practical implications of applying a multi-temporal sampling approach and using interpretative flexibility and gateway moments as heuristics in studying identification technologies and infrastructures. Firstly, adopting a multi-temporal sampling approach in the field of IT in border and migration value broadens the analytical focus and opens up new avenues for inquiry. By examining the trajectory of identification technologies over time, researchers can identify significant moments of interpretative flexibility and gateway technologies. This approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of the sociotechnical processes involved in the development and evolution of identification technologies, shedding light on their dynamics and implications.

Secondly, the heuristic of interpretative flexibility highlights the dynamic nature of identification technologies and practices. It emphasizes that technologies do not have fixed or stable meanings but are subject to interpretation and contestation by various social groups. This perspective highlights how different actors challenge or transform identification technologies and practices, influencing their trajectory and shaping outcomes. Understanding interpretative flexibility can provide insights into the possibilities for innovation, adaptation, and resistance within identification systems.

Thirdly, the heuristic of gateway moments underscores the importance of gateway technologies in bridging heterogeneous data systems and practices within identification systems and infrastructures. Gateway technologies act as crucial connectors, filling gaps and facilitating the integration of diverse systems and communities of practice. They play a significant but often underappreciated role in establishing and maintaining networks within larger-scale infrastructures. Recognizing the role of gateway technologies can inform the design and implementation of identification systems, enabling smoother data integration, interoperability, and collaboration among different stakeholders.

Overall, Chapter 6's practical implications highlight the value of adopting a multi-temporal sampling approach and utilizing heuristics such as interpretative flexibility and gateway moments to study identification technologies and infrastructures. These approaches provide insights into the social, technological, and institutional dynamics that shape identification systems, enabling researchers and practitioners to better understand, navigate, and improve the complexities of identification practices and infrastructures.

This section's discussion of theoretical and practical implications contributes to advancing our understanding of identification technologies, infrastructures, and their societal implications. The theoretical implications highlight the methodological innovations and the importance of considering data models, resistance, and the politics of data in analyzing information systems. These insights deepen our understanding of the intricate relationship between technical aspects and the broader socio-political context of identification practices. On the practical side, the implications shed light on the challenges and opportunities in re-identification processes, the integration of search and match tools, and the role of gateway technologies in bridging data systems. These practical implications can potentially inform identification system design, implementation, and improvement, ultimately contributing to more effective, user-friendly, and socially responsible practices.

Moving forward, the next section will reflect on the research process and acknowledge the limitations encountered during the study. It will provide an opportunity to critically evaluate the methodology, data collection, and analysis techniques, discussing their strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, the section will address any constraints or challenges faced throughout the research, such as data access limitations or the generalizability of findings. By reflecting on the research process and its limitations, we can gain insights into areas for improvement and generate recommendations for future research in identification technologies and infrastructures.

## Overview of the research process

The research process was guided by a methodological framework that leveraged data infrastructures as both a subject of investigation and a research resource. Drawing inspiration from Bowker and Star's notion of "infrastructural inversions," three distinct methodological strategies were employed: comparing data models, analyzing data practices, and tracing sociotechnical change. These strategies were integrated into a methodological framework, allowing for a comprehensive examination of the practices and technologies involved in matching identity data. By reversing the tendency of such infrastructure to recede into the background, this methodological approaches each shed light on the different aspects of matching identity data.

First, comparing data models provided valuable insights into the information collected by various organizations and systems. Data models of EU and EU Member State authorities were collected through desk research. Furthermore, this part of the investigation used data gathered by other researchers of the Processing Citizenship project, who gathered indirect traces of data models, such as screenshots of graphical user interfaces. The OE method enabled comparing diverse data models by employing additional steps to code, harmonize, and group all documents, categories, and values. This work was further developed in the context of the Processing Citizenship project. Drawing on analysis using the OE, @pelizzaScriptsAlterityMapping2023 introduced the notion of “scripts of alterity" to make the point that data infrastructures shape power relations with people and among states. The software has also been released as an open-source tool that can be used for analyzing information systems' data models in other domains and contexts.

The first inversion strategy employed was the comparison of data models, which provided insights into the information collected by various authorities' information systems for population management. This work included collecting data models from EU and EU Member State authorities through desk research. Other researchers' contributions from the Processing Citizenship project also provided indirect traces of data models, such as screenshots of graphical user interfaces that provided evidence of categories of data collected in systems. The introduced Ontology Explorer method enabled comparing diverse data models by employing additional steps to code, harmonize, and group all documents, categories, and values. The novelty came from integrating insights from existing classification and infrastructure studies and discourse analysis into a systematic method for analyzing data models. Drawing from an analysis of data models using the OE, @pelizzaScriptsAlterityMapping2023 built further on this work. This article introduced the concept of "scripts of alterity," highlighting how data infrastructures shape power dynamics among individuals and states. Furthermore, the OE tool used for this research has been released as open-source software [@vanrossemOntologyexplorer2021], enabling the analysis of information systems' data models in various domains and contexts beyond this study's scope.

The second infrastructural inversion strategy focused on analyzing data practices to understand the routine activities of searching and matching identity data within and across organizations. This analysis was based on data gathered through fieldwork and interviews conducted at a software supplier specializing in commercial data matching tools and the software usage by one of the company's clients. By examining the routine data practices of staff members at a migration and asylum agency, insights were gained into the tools for matching identity data to re-identify applicants throughout bureaucratic procedures. Furthermore, comparing the software's design with its actual use provided a deeper understanding of the challenges associated with identifying individuals from ambiguous data and how these challenges intersect with the software's capabilities. The research involved conducting semi-structured interviews with a diverse range of actors, including personnel from the agency that uses the software in back-office data management tasks, as well as employees from the company who were involved in different stages of the development and deployment of the software package.

The third strategy of infrastructural inversion focused on tracing sociotechnical change, examining the circulation of knowledge, technologies, and practices associated with data matching across various organizations and over time. The research employed a combination of fieldwork and interviews conducted at the same software supplier specializing in commercial data matching tools. The primary objective was to gain insights into the dynamic nature of transnational data infrastructures and uncover these systems' historical development and evolution. Adopting a longitudinal perspective revealed significant findings regarding these infrastructures' transformations, adaptations, and challenges. Exploring historical trajectories and sociotechnical networks provided valuable insights into the transnational dissemination of identification technologies, the growth of commercial solutions within the field, and the intricate interplay between identification practices and broader security agendas. The analysis thus highlighted the connections between technological advancements, market dynamics, and security imperatives, offering a nuanced understanding of how identification processes have evolved and become intricately intertwined within their socio-political landscapes.

This section has provided an overview of the research process employed in this study. By adopting a methodological framework inspired by "infrastructural inversions," the research explored data infrastructures as both a topic and a resource. Three methodological strategies were used, including comparing data models, analyzing data practices, and tracing sociotechnical change. These strategies enabled examining the interplay between identification systems and the internationalization, commercialization, and securitization of identification. Through data collection methods such as desk research, fieldwork, and interviews, insights were gained into the information collected by organizations, the everyday data practices of users, and the dynamic nature of transnational infrastructures. However, it is necessary to acknowledge the limitations and challenges faced during the research process. The next section will further reflect on the findings, including unexpected discoveries and the implications of the limitations encountered.

## Reflection on findings and limitations

During the research process, I came across some surprising discoveries that revealed how the company's software is incorporated and utilized by its customers and the impact of the broader context of data matching and identity management. These findings challenged my assumptions about the data matching tools, as the software's integration was relatively invisible to users, thus highlighting the complexities of software integration and user awareness. Also, I was surprised to discover that the software was adaptable and effective across different domains, which challenges traditional notions about the difficulty of adapting generic software to local circumstances. Throughout the research, several limitations arose that had a direct impact on the findings I was able to produce. In this section, I will examine the unexpected results, discuss the identified limitations, and reflect on the research outcomes.

Chapter 5 revealed unexpected insights about how the company's software integrates with the systems of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (IND). The findings revealed that the software's service-oriented architecture facilitated its integration, but it did not always cater to the specific needs of all users. On the one hand, this loose integration through this software architecture facilitates integration at the cost of making the search almost invisible to most users, which led to a lack of awareness about how the underlying data matching mechanisms work. In this sense, the chapter provided insights into the adaptability of generic software packages to local contexts, challenging the prevailing notion that such software solutions are inherently limited in their ability to accommodate specific requirements. On the other hand, the diverse use cases of search and data matching within the IND suggest that tighter integration with the local context and the system's graphical user interface could have provided valuable context to end users, explaining, for instance, why specific search results were included. During interviews, I discovered that users need clarification when search results include matches based on a person's historical data, such as their previous names before marriage. Such findings emphasize the importance of improving the user experience to ensure a clear understanding of search results.

Chapter 6 unveiled intriguing findings that shed light on the significant role of software integrators and suppliers. The research delved into the complex relationship between the company as a technology supplier and its relation with technology integrators, unearthing a competitive landscape within identification solutions. Notably, the study uncovered the company's involvement in border and security domains, which was influenced by the evolving landscape following the events of 9/11 in the United States. This exploration also revealed the company's ventures into biometrics and multimodal approaches, offering insights into the dynamic nature of its technological advancements. The research drew inspiration from the biography of artefacts and practices approach to question the traditional idea of identification systems as unchanging and complete projects. Instead, it highlights the ongoing development processes that shape these systems, emphasizing their continuous evolution and adaptation. These findings underscored the intricate interplay between software integrators, suppliers, and the larger socio-political context, unveiling the nuanced dynamics within the industry.

Acknowledging the limitations encountered during the research process is necessary to understand its scope and implications. These limitations impacted the extent and depth of the investigation, and they are necessary to consider when interpreting the research findings. One significant limitation was the restricted access to customers' data and systems. The company faced confidentiality restrictions that prevented them from directly viewing actual data and systems utilized by their customers. This limitation hindered their ability to gain a comprehensive understanding of how the software was being utilized and the specific challenges faced by customers in their unique contexts.

The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the research process, necessitating a shift to online research methods. This restriction limited the amount of in-person visits and observations during fieldwork. The research may have been hindered by the lack of face-to-face interactions and direct observations, which limited the research's capacity to understand the nuances of software usage and its implications.

Another limitation stemmed from the decision to focus primarily on the case of the EU VIS (Visa Information System) and the EU Member States rather than exploring the company's developments in advanced passenger information systems. While this decision aligned with the broader goals of the Processing Citizenship project, it restricted the investigation to specific projects within the company's portfolio. Additionally, the research faced constraints in interviewing specific customers due to security clearances, further narrowing the scope of the study. Researching the use of the software in the EU VIS was challenging due to the company's limited access to EU documentation. Confidentiality and gatekeeping practices by the technology integrator posed obstacles in obtaining relevant information. The restricted access to documentation limited the researchers' ability to delve deeply into the intricacies of the software implementation and its impact on identity data management in the EU context.

Despite these limitations, the research findings provide valuable insights into the integration and usage of the company's software, shedding light on critical aspects of data matching, identity management, and the broader contexts within which these technologies operate. While the limitations may have constrained the research process, they contribute to a nuanced understanding of the challenges and complexities involved in studying and analyzing data infrastructures and their implications.

Additionally, the research uncovered limitations regarding the company's direct access and knowledge about how customers utilized their software. Confidentiality restrictions prevented the company from viewing real data and systems, limiting its understanding of customers' software usage.
Limitations

The research process faced several limitations, which should be acknowledged to provide a comprehensive understanding of its scope and implications.

* Access Restrictions: There was an initial attempt to conduct fieldwork focused on the problems and technological solutions within EU institutions related to identity data in border security and migration management. However, the proposal faced common barriers to qualitative secrecy research, ultimately impeding access to the intended fieldwork site.
* COVID-19 Impact: The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a shift to online research methods, restricting the amount of in-person visits and observations during fieldwork. The limitations imposed by the pandemic reduced the scope for direct observation and face-to-face interactions.
* Scope of Fieldwork: The second fieldwork focused primarily on the case of the EU VIS (Visa Information System) and the EU Member States rather than the company's recent developments in advanced passenger information systems. This decision aligned with the broader goals of the Processing Citizenship project but restricted the investigation to specific projects within the company's portfolio. Additionally, restrictions on interviewing specific customers due to security clearances further limited the scope of the research.
* Access to Documentation: Researching the use of the software in the EU VIS was challenging due to the company's lack of direct access to EU documentation. Confidentiality and gatekeeping practices by the technology integrator prevented the company from accessing relevant information.

## Ethical considerations

Ethical considerations were carefully considered throughout the research process, particularly given the domain of borders and security in which the company operates.

Collaborating with a company involved in borders and security raised ethical concerns regarding the potential impact on individuals' security and privacy. However, interviews with personnel at the IND demonstrated the value of data matching in assisting with applications and streamlining bureaucratic processes. The software played a vital role in supporting bureaucrats' daily tasks, and its malfunctioning could hinder their ability to perform their work effectively.

Nevertheless, Chapter 6 findings shed light on the potential emergence of coded inequities. The prevalence of scientific practices in dealing with the technicalities of Arabic and Asian names could inadvertently reinforce preexisting profiling categories that disproportionately target specific individuals. As the company's software expands into airline information systems, this issue may become more pronounced. Therefore, it is essential to critically evaluate the potential implications and unintended consequences of such technological solutions.

Building upon the methodological strategies employed, the data collection process, and the reflection on findings, this research has significantly contributed to understanding data infrastructures, identity management, and the implications of data matching practices. By examining the integration of the company's software into various systems and organizations, unexpected insights were gained, challenging conventional assumptions and highlighting the role of sociotechnical factors in shaping data matching processes. Moreover, the limitations encountered during the research process shed light on the complexities of studying sensitive domains and navigating access restrictions. These contributions and ethical considerations provide a comprehensive foundation for understanding the multifaceted dynamics of data matching and its impact on individuals and systems. In the following section, the contributions and significance of this research will be further explored and discussed.
