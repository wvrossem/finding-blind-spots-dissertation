# Matching identity data in transnational security infrastructures and beyond {#ch-literature}

\chaptermark{Matching identity data}

This chapter develops the dissertation’s theoretical framework, which integrates theories and established concepts from three different scholarships studying issues which I will refer to as (1) “the internationalization and commercialization of identification”, (2) “the securitization of identification”, and (3) “the materiality and performativity of identity data”. This chapter will also focus on the intersections between these scholarships, where there are many overlapping concerns and ideas. The theoretical framework aims to clarify how the dissertation employs theories and concepts at the intersection of these three scholarships. But terms like "theoretical framework" and "conceptual framework" can be interpreted differently. Therefore, our first step is determining the function of the theoretical framework and its relationship to the conceptual framework that Chapter 3 introduces.

## Theoretical and conceptual framework

Notwithstanding social scientists’ regular use of the terms _theoretical_ and _conceptual_ framework as synonyms and interchangeable [@merriamQualitativeResearchGuide2015], it can be analytically useful to distinguish between the two types [@anfaraTheoreticalFrameworksQualitative2015; @imendaThereConceptualDifference2014; @ravitchReasonRigorHow2017]. These two concepts share a concern for the importance of social theory and its operationalization for the collection, analysis, and interpretation of empirical phenomena. Not surprising for such a loaded term as “theory”,[^loaded] there has been much discussion on the definitions and roles of theory in social science research [@abendMeaningTheory2008; @blumerWhatWrongSocial1954; @freeseFormalTheorizing1980; @mertonSociologicalTheory1945; @parsonsRoleTheorySocial1938; @turnerIntroductionNewAgenda2008]. On those accounts, the term “theory” embodies a multitude of meanings, including the well-worn definition as a “logically interconnected sets of propositions from which empirical uniformities can be derived” [@mertonSociologicalTheoriesMiddle1968, p. 39], the work of _theorists_ of classical and contemporary theory, the (causal) “explanation” of empirical social phenomena, or the perspectives/lenses/views/… which frame and shape how and what researchers look at. My use of the term theoretical framework will most closely correspond with the last definition: as a way to make explicit the integration of working theories and concepts that form the basis of the research.

[^loaded]: @abendMeaningTheory2008 notes how terms like “theory” and “theoretical” are terms that “can _simultaneously_ do descriptive and evaluative work” (p. 192, emphasis in original). That is, the terms are often used to describe research and imply an opinion of a work. Similarly, the terms theory and theoretical can imply a value judgement of whether scientists can have a detached and value-neutral perspective [cf. Mertonian norms of science -@mertonNormativeStructureScience1973]. This dissertation, as grounded in STS, that there is no such privileged position and that knowledge-making is always “situated” [@harawaySituatedKnowledgesScience1988].

<!-- [^ostrich]: Or, in the words of Talcott Parsons [-@parsonsRoleTheorySocial1938] one should avoid “following the policy of the ostrich, pretending not to theorize and thus leaving one’s theory implicit and uncriticized, thus almost certainly full of errors” (p. 15). -->

Following @ravitchReasonRigorHow2017, theoretical/conceptual frameworks can further refer to “off the shelf” frameworks or “informal” frameworks (p.5). In the first case, researchers may employ established or emerging theoretical approaches from their fields. For instance, a survey by @sovacoolOrderingTheoriesTypologies2017 highlighted social scientists' theories and concepts to understand sociotechnical diffusion and change, such as "Sociotechnical Transitions" (also known as the "Multilevel Perspective"), "Social Practice Theory", "Domestication Theory", "Large Technical Systems", "Social Construction of Technology", and  "Sociotechnical Imaginaries". Each such perspective emphasizes and questions, in its way, facets of the binary of structure and agency in the relations between technology and forms of social life and order. In the second case, theoretical concepts and backgrounds can be combined into an “informal” integrative framework. However, as @sovacoolOrderingTheoriesTypologies2017 and their respondents remark, many previous perspectives already integrate concepts from different fields. For instance, the Multilevel Perspective — which looks at long-term sociotechnical changes — already connects STS and evolutionary economics fields. If one is alert to potential incompatibilities between theories, as @sovacoolOrderingTheoriesTypologies2017 argue, “integrative theory” can be advantageous as “a way to minimize bias and arrogance, best fit a particular research topic or question, tighten concepts through critical thinking, and aid researchers in a quest for meta-theoretical triangulation” (p. 742). Hence, as a first building block in the structure of this dissertation, the theoretical framework will take an integrative approach to outline how theory and concepts frame and shape how I approach and conduct my investigations.

A second building block, the conceptual framework, will explicate how these theories and concepts come together and are situated aspects of my investigation and positionality as a researcher. In this sense, I do not follow definitions of conceptual frameworks as the particular integration of several related concepts drawn from theory for a research problem [@imendaThereConceptualDifference2014]. Instead, I concur with the difference between theoretical and conceptual frameworks defined by @milesQualitativeDataAnalysis2018. These authors describe the difference as follows:

> "[A] theoretical framework utilizes theory/theories and their constituent elements as the presumed “working model” that drives the investigation and analysis of a social phenomenon. But a conceptual framework is a more inductively derived and evolutionary model that can certainly include aspects of the theoretical, but primarily incorporates case- or site-specific variables, concepts, contexts, participants, and so on. In other words, a conceptual framework grounds itself in the local elements of a particular, unique study; a theoretical framework abstracts a study’s ideas based on the literature." (p. 15)

In this and the following Chapter, I will accordingly use the two kinds of framework to distinguish how formal theoretical concepts from the literature that underpin my research intersect with specific aspects of research (secondary research questions, methods, and goals). The theoretical framework integrates theories and established concepts that will guide me in creating the arguments in my own work. Furthermore, following debates on the performativity of language, we need to consider that the theories and concepts do not just say something about some aspect of reality but also produce real effects [@aradauPerformingMethodsPractice2017; @lawMethodMessSocial2004]. As a result, “framing” my study inside a set of theories and concepts, such as the securitization of identity or travelling software, adds to producing certain realities. In the following sections, I will more clearly define the concepts used in my problem statement and research questions to clarify these presumptions that guide my methodology and the reasoning behind my decisions in designing the research.

### Internationalization and commercialization of identification

* Transborder identification?

Identifying people on the move is a Janus-faced and multi-sited phenomenon intermingled with obligations and rights and coercive measures, which can happen far from traditional encounters at the border [@aboutIdentificationRegistrationPractices2013; @caplanDocumentingIndividualIdentity2001]. Registration and identification practices have enabled and constrained international mobility by regulating human movement. Traditionally, academics have emphasized the links between the state-making of modern nation-states and the elaboration of registration and identification systems, such as creating civil registers or passport documents [@breckenridgeRegistrationRecognitionDocumenting2012; @caplanDocumentingIndividualIdentity2001; @torpeyInventionPassportSurveillance2018].

<!-- The rise of database systems and biometric technologies has furthermore transformed identification and  -->

A term often referred for the state’s capacity to identify its citizens as a form of is the notion of _legibility_ of @scottSeeingStateHow1998. Scott noted how the increased interaction of states and their population (e.g., for purposes of taxation) went hand in hand with projects of standardization and legibility as attempts to identify its people unambiguously. So, in the example Scott, while cultural naming practices are very diverse and can serve local purposes, the standardization of surnames “was a first and crucial step toward making individual citizens officially legible” (p. 71). In these practices, the person's identity is not a problem of representation between a person and information captured about them but as a mutual constitution of identity, states, and institutions [@lyonIdentifyingCitizensID2009; @pelizzaIdentificationTranslationArt2021].

These initial scholarly efforts thus took as primacy the state practices of identifying. Only recently, scholars have started to pay attention to identification and registration practices from a transnational perspective [@aboutIdentificationRegistrationPractices2013]. Historians have shown how efforts such as policing beyond the national domain @caplanDocumentingIndividualIdentity2001 have been “the source of repeated efforts to rationalize and standardize practices of identification and the systems for the storage and retrieval of the expanding documentation that this generated” (p. 9). In this day and age, international bodies such as the European Union, the United Nations, Interpol, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and the International Organization for Standardization play an essential role in projects of rationalizing and standardizing identification systems. The ICAO, for instance, publishes specifications for machine-readable travel documents and visas (Doc 9303) to assure “global interoperability”.

Another example is the US government agency ANSI/NIST-ITL which publishes de facto standards for the interchange of fingerprint, facial, and other biometric information. Yet, while a transnational perspective to identification draws attention to the increased number of actors involved in the standardization of identification, there needs to be more discussion about how new forms of identification of link and cross-check personal data from various national and international databases are practically achieved. For instance, to verify identities for visa applications, to detect identity fraud by linking identities across national and international policing systems, or to match flight passengers’ data against global watch lists.

A transnational perspective also highlights the influence of what could be called the commercialization of identification. In the EU context, the political economy of identity management has been shown to consist of only a small network of companies that design, implement, and maintain identity management systems [@lemberg-pedersenPoliticalEconomyEntry2020; @valdiviaNeitherOpaqueTransparent2022]. These small networks have various risks that complicate the relations between standardizing and rationalizing identification as the “involved companies become indispensable, and are granted roles as unrivalled experts in the systems of border control they themselves have designed.” [@lemberg-pedersenPoliticalEconomyEntry2020, p. 71]. Rather than a fully coherent system for making people on the move legible, there is a fragmented landscape of systems, and data models, where state vision needs “fixing” [@leeseFixingStateVision2020] in an age of increased mobility and associated risks (and benefits).

### Securitization of identification

The previous Chapter has noted how public and private actors have increasingly connected the identification of people at the border with issues of terrorism and international security. As (Critical) Security Studies (CSS) scholars remind us, such construction of identification as a security concern pushes the notions of traditional understandings of security that should not be taken for granted. Whereas traditionally, security was primarily seen as protection of the state (_national security_), CSS scholars have scrutinized the proliferation of security in various ways. Hence, scholars have questioned, “the precise definition of what it means to be secure, the causes of insecurity and who or what the concept of security should apply to” [@peoplesCriticalSecurityStudies2021, p. 2]. In this way, CSS has reformulated the problem of security by “broadening” and “deepening” the areas, issues, and actors of security [@burgessRoutledgeHandbookNew2010; @peoplesCriticalSecurityStudies2021]. Security has been broadened to include other areas and threats, such as migration and border security, or health (as the Covid-19 pandemic has shown) besides the traditional focus on more militaristic dimensions. In addition, what is to be secured (also known as the _referent object_ of security) has been deepened to include other actors such as human individuals, cultural/identity groups, multinational corporations, institutions, or even ecosystems. These critical approaches to security help ground discussing the securitization of identification within sweeping changes of perceiving and addressing different societal phenomena as security issues.

A key question for security scholars is how a particular societal phenomenon, such as identification at the border, is constructed as a threat/security concern. In “traditional” or “essentialist” understandings of security, we may take it for given that there exist security threats out there in the world that needs to be confronted by security experts and authorities.[^traditional] But what if the process works the other way around: how do societies declare certain things as security issues, and what are the social and political effects? This alternative view is generally how constructivist theories of security share a concern for security as a meaning-making (intersubjective) process in which the interaction and communication between actors construct meanings of the world and shape actors’ identities and power relations. Thus, we should take seriously the co-constitutive effects of discourses (including other material objects and data besides words, and speech acts) on the securitization of identification and the actors involved.

[^traditional]: In comparison, “traditional” or “state-centric” accounts of security may emphasize the state as a referent object and politics as between sovereign nation-states, which gives rise to conceptions of security of states seeking security under “anarchic” conditions [@peoplesCriticalSecurityStudies2021; @waltRealismSecurity2017]. In this view, an innate competition between states forces each to protect their sovereignty from, in this case, threats to states' economy, identity, etc., by migration.

Following these scholarships, for identification to become an issue of (in)security, various social, political, and technical work needs to be carried out. The original “securitization theory” focuses on the performativity of language and how the speech acts of security help bring it into existence [@buzanSecurityNewFramework1998]. Following the Austin speech act theory, one can distinguish between illocutionary and perlocution speech acts. Illocutionary speech acts can bring about certain realities. In contrast, perlocutionary speech acts are utterances from which effects follow only when certain other kinds of conditions are in place. Hence, only specific security actors with the right audience can declare claim security. According to this scholarship, this discursive construction of particular issues as threat/security concern (referent object) has specific political effects and allows for extraordinary measures and policies. However, this view also makes it possible to consider how some issues can be de-securitized and brought back into everyday politics.

<!-- In the case of the securitization of identification is closely linked to how, in the European context, the movement of people, which at one point was promoted as positive, has been gradually linked to issues of terrorism and internal societal security [@peoplesCriticalSecurityStudies2021].  -->

Besides the rhetorical structuring of security issues, scholars set about to understand how security is enacted in the everyday practices of security professionals. Simultaneously there has been a shift in the simultaneous evolution of security devices, actors and practices. Literature on the securitization of border control showed that practices and technologies constitute the meanings of the (in)security of borders and border control. For example, Bigo [-@bigoSecuritizationPracticesThree2014] observed three kinds of meanings actors gave to the border practices of border control: as ‘solid’, something to be defended and linked to sovereignty; as ‘liquid’, relating to how borders can be controlled through filtering and identifying populations; as ‘cloudy’, only visible through the use of digital databases and analytics. In the three meanings described by Bigo, the actors' practices and uses of visual technologies, in turn, informed the meanings they attribute to border control. So, on the one hand, the practices and technologies can contribute to the securitization of borders and mobility. On the other hand, meanings attributed to borders and border control shape the technologies developed and employed. Furthermore, market technologies are the small and mundane things shaping security infrastructures as new technologies can reorganize and securitize existing practices.
