# Mapping the theoretical landscape: Unravelling the complexity of matching identity data in transnational security infrastructures {#ch-literature}

\chaptermark{Theoretical framework}

This chapter presents a mapping of theoretical concepts based on literature from four broadly defined areas of research, which will be referred to as (1) “the internationalization of identification”, (2) “the commercialization of identification”, (3) “the securitization of identification”, and (4) “the infrastructuring of identification”. This theoretical mapping seeks to identify overlapping ideas, theories, and concepts in these areas. The chapter maps the complex and dynamic relationships between identification, security, and infrastructure by pinpointing these connections. Moreover, such a mapping will enable us to recognize new perspectives and insights that integrate concepts from multiple fields, ultimately contributing to a more comprehensive and performative understanding of matching identity data in transnational security infrastructures.

The theoretical mapping approach thus provides an overview of core theories and concepts that helps contextualize the research. While this mapping provides a basis for the following chapters, each empirical chapter will delve into supplementary literature to answer the research questions relevant to that chapter. Furthermore, since this study draws on multiple disciplines, various sections draw on specific additional literature. However, the theories and concepts introduced in this chapter will play an integral role throughout the dissertation, albeit in varying degrees of explicitness. This multifaceted approach helps ensure that each aspect of the investigation is addressed within its most appropriate context.

The following section first explains what the theoretical mapping presented in this chapter means and how it works in conjunction with the methodological framework presented in Chapter 3. First, theoretical mapping is used in this dissertation to integrate and compare theories and concepts from multiple research fields and topics more or less directly pertinent to personal data matching. Second, theoretical mapping plays a role in identifying gaps in the existing literature and formulating the research questions, as it allows for considering pertinent concepts and theories from different literature. Chapter 3 then adds to this theoretical mapping by introducing the methodological framework, a written and visual representation of the specific research, hypotheses, and methods of data collection and analysis that will be used to answer the research questions.

## Internationalization of identification

Identifying people on the move is frequently described as a Janus-faced and multi-sited state-led phenomenon entwined with obligations, rights, and coercive measures that can even occur far from traditional border encounters [e.g., @aboutIdentificationRegistrationPractices2013; @caplanDocumentingIndividualIdentity2001]. The accompanying development of registration and identification systems, such as the creation of civil registers or passports, has, indeed, typically been linked to the state-making of modern nation-states [@breckenridgeRegistrationRecognitionDocumenting2012; @caplanDocumentingIndividualIdentity2001; @torpeyInventionPassportSurveillance2018]. Because identification consequently enables states to track people’s movements and label some as irregular, registration and identification systems and procedures have been argued to facilitate and limit people's freedom of movement across international borders [@broedersDataficationMobilityMigration2016; @squireContestedPoliticsMobility2010; @torpeyInventionPassportSurveillance2018].

A term often referred to for the state’s capacity to identify its citizens is the notion of _legibility_ by @scottSeeingStateHow1998. Scott noted how the interaction of premodern states and their population (e.g., for purposes of taxation) went hand in hand with projects of standardization and legibility as attempts to identify its people unambiguously. So, in one example, Scott noted the standardization of diverse cultural naming practices serving specific local purposes in distinct and fixed surnames as “a first and crucial step toward making individual citizens officially legible” (p. 71). Thus, Scott argues that state initiatives like rationalizing surnames enabled states to develop the modern statecraft apparatus, which includes taxpayer lists, conscription lists, censuses, and property deeds, by allowing states to identify the vast majority of their inhabitants unambiguously. Civil registries, identity cards, passports, DNA profiles, and other biometric databases have supplanted fixed surnames. Still, they all serve the same purpose: to make people legible for interactions with states.

Research on the history of identification generally focuses on these state practices of identifying people. For example, @torpeyInventionPassportSurveillance2018, author of the book “The invention of the passport" originally published in 2000, uses Max Weber's aphorism on the legitimacy of the state's use of violence to argue that identification practices gave nation-states a "monopoly of the legitimate means of movement” (p. 2) at the expense of non-state actors like churches and private organizations. Torpey argued that states needed to issue identification documents to maintain the separation between nationals and foreigners and regulate their mobility.

Extending the scope of the discussion beyond the borders of the nation-state, similar registration and identification techniques have been shown to help colonial authorities gain and maintain power, albeit to varying degrees of success [@breckenridgeRegistrationRecognitionDocumenting2012]. The categories of registration and identification systems institutionalized the relationships between the empire’s centre and periphery. However, as @aboutIntroduction2013 points out, registration and identification systems in such imperial and colonial contexts should not be viewed solely as instruments of coercion. What is interesting for our discussion here is how the historical analyses in those edited volumes from @breckenridgeRegistrationRecognitionDocumenting2012 and @aboutIdentificationRegistrationPractices2013 show how identification technologies were brought into a colonial setting, adapted to local conditions and eventually circulated back and forth between the global power centres.

An illustration of such international exchanges of identification technology is provided by @sengooptaImprintRajHow2004, who described that significant advancements in fingerprinting resulted from interactions between colonizers and colonized in the British Empire in India. Interestingly, Sengoopta compares the history of fingerprinting to the spread of curry dishes in English cuisine: "Developed in India but not indigenous, British but not evolved in Britain itself … incorporated into British tradition and then gradually re-transmitted to the world at large, blur[ring] the simplistic distinction we often make between home and Empire" [p. 6, quoted in @coleReviewImprintRaj2005]. While an overview of the history of forensic fingerprinting is beyond the scope of this chapter,[^cole] the main takeaway is that fingerprinting as an identification method has a complicated history, starting with scientists on the European continent, moving through British India's colonial provinces, and finally returning to Victorian England’s Scotland Yard. Therefore, the circulation of identification theories, techniques, and practices reveals the international aspects of identification technology, which can be better understood when considering perspectives beyond the conventional nation-state-based approach.

[^cole]: For a comprehensive overview of the history of fingerprinting in law enforcement, see @coleSuspectIdentitiesHistory2001.

The international nature of identification technologies is especially visible in international policing. International police work goes beyond state practices because of the need to "identify, recog­nize, and track suspects or offenders across an expanding national and eventually international terrain," as the editors of a volume titled "Documenting individual identity: the development of state practices in the modern world" [@caplanDocumentingIndividualIdentity2001, p.9] write. The essays in the book discuss nineteenth-century transnational innovations in identification, such as Bertillon's anthropometric identification system, which became widely used in France and other countries, and the Vucetich fingerprint identification system, which spread from Argentina to other Latin American countries. Based on such examples, the editors note in the book's introduction how policing has been "the source of repeated efforts to rationalize and standardize practices of identification and the systems for the storage and retrieval of the expanding documentation that this generated" (p. 9). International policing, with its emphasis on identifying and tracking suspects across borders, has contributed to the rationalization and standardization of identification practices and technologies.

However, despite the increasing prevalence of identification systems that link identity data from various national and international databases, not much research has been conducted on the operational deployment and utilization of such systems. This scarce research stands in contrast to the amount of real-world examples where such systems have been implemented. Some literature briefly touches upon this point and provides a few examples. For instance, such interconnected database systems are essential for identity verification in the context of Schengen visa applications [e.g., @glouftsiosDesigningDigitalBorders2019] and for detecting potential threats by linking identities across national and international policing and watch listing systems [e.g., @goedePoliticsSecurityLists2016; @zureikGlobalSurveillancePolicing2005]. However, these edited volumes do not dedicate much attention to other sources of data crucial for the internationalization of identification: the development of international standards for identification [@leeseStandardizingSecurityBusiness2018; @torpeyInventionPassportSurveillance2018]. Further investigation and analysis are thus necessary to understand the operational implementation and implications of the methods, techniques, and tools used to link identity data across databases.

Surprisingly, the essays in Part 1 of @aboutIdentificationRegistrationPractices2013 on "The Central State: Systems, Standards, and Techniques" continue to give priority to state-led standardization projects. This is surprising because current efforts to rationalize and standardize identification systems rely heavily on the work of organizations like the European Commission, the United Nations, Interpol, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). For example, the ICAO publishes guidelines for machine-readable passports and visas [@iso/iecIdentificationCardsMachine2008] to ensure “global interoperability”. The American National Standards Institute/National Institute of Standards and Technology Identification Technology Laboratory (ANSI/NIST-ITL) is an example of a government agency that publishes de facto standards for exchanging biometric information such as fingerprints and facial images. In short, rather than a fully coherent system for making people on the move legible, there is more likely a fragmented landscape of systems and data models — and where state vision often needs “fixing” [@leeseFixingStateVision2022] to identify people across international systems.

This section has discussed the internationalization of identification, which refers to research into identification practices that extend beyond the boundaries of the nation-state. The need to identify people across borders has brought attention to the importance of identification technology and the efforts to standardize it. Since identification relies heavily on data standards, it is crucial to develop methods to investigate the interconnections between different organizations' and authorities' data models. Additionally, it is necessary to understand how these identification technologies can travel and be used by various authorities, states, and organizations. Therefore, it is essential to consider the actors involved in developing these technologies, which often include commercial entities.

## Commercialization of identification

The edited volume "Identification and registration practices in transnational perspective" [@aboutIdentificationRegistrationPractices2013] is an excellent example of the growing interest in studying identification and registration procedures from an international or transnational perspective in the fields of social and historical research. Furthermore, a transnational viewpoint like this one shifts the focus away from the nation-state and onto the various other actors involved in identification. The editors thus highlight how the volume paves the way for new research into the "increasing takeover of individual identification by corporate bodies for economic purposes" (p. 2). Indeed, as noted by @higgsConsumingIdentityConsuming2013 in one of the essays, “the contemporary state’s use of identification technologies, including biometrics, is often dependent upon products created by commercial vendors, who have helped to drive their adoption” (p. 165). Thus, it is interesting to see a growing body of literature acknowledge the importance of non-state and commercial actors in identification processes and technologies [see also @pelizzaIdentificationTranslationArt2021]. This is a topic that has, unfortunately, been explored in a disjointed fashion.

Even though "identification technology is increasingly a commercial product, rather than a creation of the state," as @higgsConsumingIdentityConsuming2013 put it succinctly (p. 165), social and historical research has not followed suit by giving equal weight to these commercial aspects of identification. Higgs makes an interesting observation about how historians tend to give the state's identification more weight than, say, commercial enterprises where access to historical records is more closed. Higgs' essay is able to paint a broad picture of the commercial aspect of identification by looking at technological advancements made by private companies in Britain at the beginning of the 18th century. His examples include banks' use of credit and debit cards to identify customers, supermarkets' use of loyalty cards to create consumer profiles and credit reference agencies' determination of a person's creditworthiness. Perhaps unsurprisingly, he concludes his article with the well-documented fact that an increasing number of commercial IT companies actively promote biometric identity systems [see, for example, @amooreBiometricBordersGoverning2006; @olwigBiometricBorderWorld2019; @trauttmansdorffFabricationNecessaryPolicy2022; @zureikGovernanceSecurityTechnology2004].

Higgs and other of the books' essays highlight a gradual shift away from state authorities creating and implementing identification technology to the state purchasing systems created by commercial organizations. Indeed, in the EU context, the political economy of identity management has been shown to consist of only a small network of companies that design, implement, and maintain identity management systems [@lemberg-pedersenPoliticalEconomyEntry2020; @valdiviaNeitherOpaqueTransparent2022]. These small networks have various risks that complicate the relations between standardizing and rationalizing identification as the “involved companies become indispensable, and are granted roles as unrivalled experts in the systems of border control they themselves have designed.” [@lemberg-pedersenPoliticalEconomyEntry2020, p. 71]. @pelizzaIdentificationTranslationArt2021 provides another example of how technology facilitating identification encounters in Greece forges transnational associations with the EU Commission, corporate contractors, and the US security regime through the production of hardware that adheres to US biometric standards, while also leading to vendor lock-in due to the use of proprietary algorithms to create biometric templates. While the significance of commercial identification systems is clear, little is known about the processes involved in their procurement, development, implementation, and deployment.

Beyond that, little is known about the consequences of such international and commercial identification technology on the processes used by states to identify people on the move. A compelling element of @higgsConsumingIdentityConsuming2013's line of reasoning is how he shows not only the impact that commercial innovations have had on the widespread uptake of digital identification technology. Notably, he argues that the uptake and replication of these identification technologies and practices shape how states identify their populace. Therefore, this interdependence highlights the need for research on the evolution and diffusion of identification expertise and technology within and between various public and private institutions.

In summary, investigating the commercialization of identification provides insights into the proliferation of commercially and internationally available identification systems, which introduces new challenges and complexities. This commercialization is characterized by a shift from state-driven development and implementation of identification technology to state adoption of systems developed by commercial organizations. By delving into the expanded role of commercial actors, we uncover the creation of transnational associations and the potential for vendor lock-in, shedding light on the intricate relationships and power dynamics that underlie the commercialization of identification. The next section moves to the securitization of identification, delving into the interplay between these commercial aspects and security, and how security concerns shape and are shaped by the design and utilization of identification systems.

## Securitization of identification

The identification of people at the border has become increasingly linked by public and private actors to issues of terrorism and international security, as noted in the preceding chapter's examples from the ongoing EU interoperability project. According to (Critical) Security Studies (CSS) scholars, such construction of identification as a security concern supplants traditional understandings of security and should not be taken for granted. Although security has long been associated with state protection (_national security_), recent scholarship in CSS has examined the phenomenon's growing influence in new contexts, such as migration, health, and food. As a result, scholars have called into question "the precise definition of what it means to be secure, the causes of insecurity, and who or what the concept of security should apply to" [@peoplesCriticalSecurityStudies2021, p. 2]. In this way, CSS has reformulated the security issue with what is commonly referred to as “broadening” and “deepening” the security-related areas, problems, and actors [@burgessRoutledgeHandbookNew2010; @peoplesCriticalSecurityStudies2021].

On the one hand, security can be characterized as having been "broadened" from its traditional emphasis on more militaristic dimensions to include other areas and threats, such as migration and border security, or health (as the Covid-19 pandemic has shown). On the other hand, what is to be secured (also known as the _referent object_ of security) can be characterized as having been “deepened” to include other actors such as human individuals, cultural/identity groups, multinational corporations, institutions, or even ecosystems. This broadening and deepening of security helps us better understand the shifting dynamics of societal issues like migration and mobility, as well as how different actors are perceived and addressed within the realm of security concerns. Scholars in this field, for example, argue that the securitization of migration in Europe has resulted in policies that criminalize and stigmatize migrants while ignoring the root causes of displacement [e.g., @huysmansEuropeanUnionSecuritization2000]. Similarly, we can see how identification has come to be securitized by looking at the techniques and procedures used for identification.

A crucial question for security scholars is how a specific societal phenomenon, like human migration, health, or the environment, is framed as a threat or security concern. The existence of security threats that need to be dealt with by security authorities and experts may be taken for granted in “traditional” or “essentialist” understandings of security.[^traditional] What if, however, the appearance of security threats operates in reverse? How do societies label specific issues as security threats, and what societal and political consequences does this have? This alternative view is generally how constructivist theories of security share a concern for security as a meaning-making (intersubjective) process in which the interaction and communication between actors construct meanings of the world and shape actors’ identities and power relations [@balzacqConstructivismSecuritizationStudies2009; @peoplesCriticalSecurityStudies2021]. Therefore, throughout the dissertationm it is essential to keep in mind the co-constitutive effects of discourses on the securitization of identification and the actors.

[^traditional]: "Traditional" or "state-centric" accounts of security, on the other hand, see international relations as occurring only between sovereign nation-states, with states seeking security in a global environment with no universal rules [@peoplesCriticalSecurityStudies2021; @waltRealismSecurity2017]. According to this theory, states' inherent competition with one another would compel them to defend their sovereignty against external threats, in this case, the economic and identity threats posed by migrants.

<!-- In accordance with critical and constructivist perspectives on security, for identification to become a matter of (in)security and securitize, various social, political, and technical work needs to be performed. Security scholars are generally interested in how various discourses, languages, objects, practices, and infrastructure actualize and materialize notions of security.  -->

Constructivist approaches to security share a common interest in the social construction of security, but they differ in their emphasis on different aspects of the processes.[^constructivist] For instance, “securitization theory” strongly emphasizes how language, discourse, and power all play a part in how security is constructed and the value of critical analysis in challenging the prevailing security narratives and fostering new perspectives on security [ @balzacqThreeFacesSecuritization2005; @buzanSecurityNewFramework1998; @mcdonaldSecuritizationConstructionSecurity2008; @taureckSecuritizationTheorySecuritization2006]. It is important to note that the theory arose out of a concern with the “intellectual and political dangers in simply tacking the word _security_ onto an ever wider range of issues” [@buzanSecurityNewFramework1998, p. 1, emphasis in original]. The core ideas of securitization theory can be attributed to scholars such as Buzan, Waever, and others [@buzanSecurityNewFramework1998; @waeverIdentityMigrationNew1993] who argue that speech acts that treat certain issues as security threats can lead to the expansion of security concerns into other "sectors." That is, how some issues or problems are framed as security threats and elevated to the status of urgent problems requiring extraordinary action.[^desecuritization]

[^desecuritization]: Furthermore, securitization theory enables one to think about the inverse process: how issues might be de-securitized and reintroduced into regular politics.

[^constructivist]: In the fields of security and international relations, some of the earliest sources for the constructivist approach are @adlerSeizingMiddleGround1997, @buzanSecurityNewFramework1998, @huysmansSecurityWhatYou1998, and @wendtAnarchyWhatStates1992.

Securitization theory thus clarifies the implications of simply adding "security" to identification. If identification is being securitized, then the process of securitization entails presenting identification as a pressing security threat. This framing then justifies the use of extraordinary measures to address identification security issues. Chapter 1 provided some examples of how securitization of identification may be seen in the context of the European Union's interoperability framework. In those quotations from policy documents, EU authorities framed the risks of unlinked data as threats to the internal security of the EU as these “unknown unknowns” or “blind spots” are presented as risks that can be exploited by individuals seeking to evade authorities. The construction of identification as a critical security concern supports what could be considered exceptional measures to address these risks through the EU's interoperability framework. For example, the integration of multiple databases and information systems, including those related to visas, asylum, and criminal records that were previously unconnected. Of course, such securitization can also fail if it receives little political or societal backing, as it may be seen as unjustified or out of proportion to the actual security threat.

Securitization theory has been criticized for its focus on the role of the state and its security apparatus in the construction of security issues [@aradauSecurityDemocraticScene2004; @bertrandCanSubalternSecuritize2018; @mcdonaldSecuritizationConstructionSecurity2008; @peoplesCriticalSecurityStudies2021]. Such a viewpoint emphasizes those who can speak, excluding those who have historically and structurally been marginalized. This results in a narrow understanding of security that fails to consider the complexity and diversity of security methods and devices. Therefore, besides the rhetorical structuring of security issues and the performativity of security speech, scholars set about to understand how security is enacted through security devices and in the everyday practices of security professionals [@balzacqSecurityPractices2010; @cote-boucherBorderSecurityPractice2014; @davidshoferTechnologySecurityPractices2017]. Hence, analysis of the technologies, procedures, and protocols used to implement security measures, as well as how these measures are experienced and contested by those subjected to them. Scholars have provided a more comprehensive understanding of how security is enacted and experienced in practice by focusing on the material and embodied dimensions of security [@amicelleQuestioningSecurityDevices2015].

A helpful example of a focus on such security practices is given by Bigo [-@bigoSecuritizationPracticesThree2014], who observed a least three different meanings actors attributed to border control: "solid," something to be defended and connected to sovereignty; "liquid," referring to how borders can be controlled through filtering and identifying populations; and "cloudy," only discernible through the use of digital databases and analytics. In all three of Bigo's examples, the actors' practices and uses of security technology affected the meanings they gave to border control. On the one hand, the practices and technologies can contribute to the securitization of borders and mobility. On the other hand, the technologies created and used are shaped by the meanings attached to borders and border control. Consequently, examining identification practices and devices makes sense to determine whether, when, and how they might be securitized.

<!-- Additionally, market technologies shape security infrastructures in minor and routine ways, as new technology can reorganize and securitize existing practices. -->

In recent years, materialist security studies have emerged as a new approach to understanding security practices and technology [e.g., @aradauInfrastructure2012; @aradauCriticalMethodsInternational2014; @bellanovaAlgorithmicRegulationSecurity2022; @hoijtinkTechnologyAgencyInternational2019; @waltersDroneStrikesDingpolitik2014]. Their approaches generally focus on material objects, such as devices, shaping security practices and outcomes. Materialist security studies seek to account for the development and use of devices in security practices and the agency of these devices. According to @pelizzaIdentificationTranslationArt2021, one compelling feature of materialist security studies is their potential for blurring boundaries between states, private organizations, and commercial entities. Devices like surveillance cameras or biometric scanners are often developed and deployed by various actors, including governments, private security firms, and technology companies. As a result, examining security devices can disentangle different actors' roles and interests in shaping security practices.

Furthermore, devices are not just passive tools in security practices; they also have performativity and can actualize security [e.g., @amicelleQuestioningSecurityDevices2015; @bellanovaControllingSchengenInformation2022; @davidshoferTechnologySecurityPractices2017]. <!--TODO: Add examples--> This means that devices can shape security practices in ways that are not always predictable or fully understood. A materialist perspective on security studies provides a valuable framework for understanding the role of devices in shaping security practices. By focusing on the materiality of security, this approach helps to illuminate the complex relationships between actors, devices, and security outcomes.

Finally, the literature on Science, Technology, and Society (STS) has extensively explored identification in security settings, such as in the context of identifying possible threats in warfare through the lens of sociotechnologies [@follisVisionTransterritoryBorders2017; @suchmanTrackingTargetingSociotechnologies2017]. In addition, scholars like Lucy Suchman have highlighted how the use of algorithmic systems and other technological tools can shape our understanding of what counts as a threat and who is considered a legitimate target [@suchmanTrackingTargetingSociotechnologies2017; @suchmanAlgorithmicWarfareReinvention2020]. Furthermore, much of this work emphasizes how the use of sociotechnologies to identify legitimate targets for protection can also have unintended consequences that create insecurity for others.

In conclusion, critical security studies have drawn attention to how societal issues can be transformed into matters of security and the potential implications of such transformations. In light of this, we should question the rationale behind labelling identification as a security issue. Earlier theories in this field were often limited by a state-centric perspective and a focus on the discourse and speech acts of dominant actors, such as states and security professionals. Recent scholarship has emphasized the materiality and performativity of security practices and devices, as well as their potential to create insecurity for certain groups. This thesis seeks to investigate how security infrastructures shape and are shaped by the specific practices and devices utilized in matching and linking identity data. By examining these processes, we can better understand how identification practices can become securitized and the potential implications for individuals and society.

## Infrastructuring of identification

Literature on infrastructure has long demonstrated how data infrastructures reflect and shape the values, interests, and power relations of the actors involved in their design and operation, which consequently shapes practices [e.g., @bowkerSortingThingsOut1999; @edwardsIntroductionAgendaInfrastructure2009; @hansethDevelopingInformationInfrastructure1996; @kitchinCriticalDataStudies2018]. This has particular relevance in border security and migration control, where identifying and tracking individuals across different systems and databases have become crucial components of state surveillance and control. For example, @glouftsiosGoverningBorderSecurity2021 demonstrated how the often-invisible maintenance of large-scale information systems for border security in the EU has an essential role in sustaining the governance of international mobility. Likewise, @pelizzaScriptsAlterityMapping2023, through the notion of “scripts of alterity”, make the point that data infrastructures shape power relations with people and among states. The systems and data infrastructure for identifying people have thus rightly been a frequent concern of studies on border security and migration control [see, for example, @dijstelbloemBordersInfrastructureTechnopolitics2021; @glouftsiosGoverningBorderSecurity2021; @pollozekInfrastructuringEuropeanMigration2019]. In this context, data infrastructures consisting of biometric databases, watchlists, and other migration and border management systems are designed to collect, share, and analyze individuals' data to enable their identification, categorization, and management.

Defining what constitutes infrastructure often poses a significant challenge due to its multifaceted and dynamic nature [e.g., @edwardsUnderstandingInfrastructureDynamics2007; @larkinPoliticsPoeticsInfrastructure2013; @karastiKnowledgeInfrastructuresPart2016; @monteiroArtefactsInfrastructures2013; @starStepsEcologyInfrastructure1996]. There are various ways to approach the conceptualization of infrastructure, each offering valuable insights into its defining characteristics. One notable perspective, as proposed by @starStepsEcologyInfrastructure1996, emphasizes infrastructure dimensions such as embeddedness, transparency, reach/scope, learned as part of membership, links with conventions of practice, the embodiment of standards, built on an installed base, and becoming visible on breakdown. This viewpoint highlights how both social and technical factors are influenced by and influence the practices and norms of the communities in which infrastructure is built.

For instance, by applying the dimensions of @starStepsEcologyInfrastructure1996 to data infrastructure for identification, we could gain insight into the complex interaction between information systems and work practices. The embeddedness of infrastructure within work practices would highlight how individuals integrate identification systems as part of a community of practice, gradually becoming familiar with and proficient in their use. As such, the data infrastructure may become transparent as expertise grows, facilitating seamless interaction with identification systems. Notably, such infrastructure is not static but evolves over time. The construction of new identification systems often builds upon existing ones, acknowledging their limitations while adhering to established standards. This dynamic thus allows infrastructure to operate imperceptibly, remaining invisible to users until a significant event, such as a breakdown, occurs. All in all, these dimensions of infrastructure underscore its inherent relational and context-dependent nature, as aptly described by @starStepsEcologyInfrastructure1996: "infrastructure is a fundamentally relational concept. It becomes infrastructure in relation to organized practices" (p. 113).

Similarly, @larkinPoliticsPoeticsInfrastructure2013 captures the ontology of infrastructure as both "things and also the relation between things." These relational perspectives emphasize that infrastructure extends beyond its tangible components and encompasses the intricate interdependencies and connections that facilitate its functionality. It underscores the significance of comprehending infrastructure as a network of relationships and dependencies, where material elements intertwine with social and organizational factors. Moreover, what may be considered infrastructure for one person or organization might not hold the same significance for others [@starEthnographyInfrastructure1999]. The understanding of infrastructure is contingent upon individual perspectives, disciplinary boundaries, and specific sociotechnical contexts. Different actors may identify and engage with particular infrastructures based on their unique needs, interests, and positions within the broader socio-political landscape.

In the context of defining infrastructures, it is necessary to consider the impact of the rise of Big Data and its implications for the generation, circulation, and utilization of data [@borgmanBigDataLittle2015; @daltonWhatDoesCritical2014; @kitchinDataRevolutionBig2014]. This development has sparked interest in fields like Critical Data Studies (CDS), which seek to uncover the underlying power structures inherent in data practices [@flyverbomDatastructuringOrganizingCurating2018; @iliadisCriticalDataStudies2016; @kitchinCriticalDataStudies2018]. While previous research on infrastructures and social order has taken a relational approach, scholars associated within CDS employ critical frameworks to highlight the power dynamics at play in data processes [@iliadisCriticalDataStudies2016, p. 2]. Furthermore, they emphasize that data is never raw but shaped by choices and constraints [see also, @gitelmanRawDataOxymoron2013]. These two strands of research are complementary. CDS has raised important questions about how the connections between different mechanisms and elements constituting data influence power relations. For instance, which aspects of everyday experiences are subject to datafication, and which ones remain invisible?

The definitions and characteristics discussed bring attention to the dynamic nature of infrastructures as they undergo evolution and adaptation in response to technological advancements, policy changes, and organizational shifts. This raises the question of whether infrastructure can be purposefully designed and built. For instance, @edwardsUnderstandingInfrastructureDynamics2007 emphasizes that infrastructure does not arise from the intentional design but grows in phases. This perspective aligns with @hughesNetworksPowerElectrification1983's account of the historical growth of the electrical supply network, where expansion often resulted from addressing critical problems within existing systems. In addition, Edwards et al. highlight the significance of constructing gateways as a pivotal phase in infrastructure development. During these stages, multiple systems compete without a clear winner, and gateways facilitate interoperability among them, enabling a unified, integrated system, albeit with occasional challenges requiring user intervention. Recognizing the dynamic nature of infrastructures is essential when examining their role in identification systems. By acknowledging their distinct growth phases and their ability to address critical issues, we can understand the capabilities, limitations, and broader implications of these infrastructures within the realm of identification.

In the context of this dissertation, a working definition of data infrastructure, specifically in relation to identification, is adopted. Here, data infrastructure refers to the underlying systems, technologies, regulations, and practices that enable identity data collection, storage, and management. It is essential to note that data infrastructures extend beyond physical or technical components. They encompass sociotechnical arrangements, governance structures, and institutional frameworks that are integral to the functioning of identification systems. Data infrastructures form a complex network of interconnected elements that shape how identity data is created, circulated, managed, and utilized. By recognizing the multidimensionality and relational nature of data infrastructures, this research seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of their role in the context of identification practices and their implications for individuals and society at large.

Understanding such dynamics and challenges of data infrastructures in the context of identification systems is crucial. Collecting, storing, and exchanging identity data rely on complex networks of interconnected systems and organizations. Effective interoperability can be necessary to identify people across infrastructures. Still, it can be hindered by the diverse data formats, protocols, and standards employed by different systems. To examine the interplay between data infrastructures and identification systems, it is necessary to explore the design, implementation, and governance of data infrastructures. Furthermore, understanding infrastructures helps us analyze the implications of identifying individuals across complex data ecosystems. Finally, it enables us to explore how these infrastructures influence and mediate the matching and linking of identity data, thereby shedding light on the shaping and utilization of identity data and the broader implications for transnational security infrastructures.

## Research questions

### Main research question

This chapter has further defined the research problem and unpacked it in light of the four broadly defined research areas (1) the internationalization of identification”, (2) "the commercialization of identification, (3) the securitization of identification, and (4) the infrastructuring of identification. By analyzing the relevant literature within these areas, we have gained a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between identification and transnational security infrastructures. In addition, the literature review has allowed us to identify key themes within each research area, including the growing use of internationally developed and commercially available identification systems and the increasing securitization of identification processes. These themes have helped to clarify the broader context of identity data matching in the context of transnational commercial security infrastructures.

Through our examination of the internationalization and commercialization of identification, we have identified a gap in research regarding the specific ways in which the spread of commercially and internationally available identification technologies impact identification processes. Similarly, in our exploration of the securitization of identification, we have identified a gap in research regarding how security concerns shape and are shaped by the design and use of identification systems. This securitization can be seen in the growing emphasis on biometric identification in border control and the linking of identity data to identify security threats. Finally, our examination of the infrastructuring of identification has highlighted a gap in research regarding the implications of identifying people across complex data infrastructures.

Through our examination of the internationalization and commercialization of identification, we have identified a gap in research regarding the specific ways in which the spread of commercially and internationally available identification technologies impact identification processes. Similarly, in our exploration of the securitization of identification, we have identified a gap in research regarding how security concerns shape and are shaped by the design and use of identification systems. This securitization can be seen in the growing emphasis on biometric identification in border control and the linking of identity data to identify security threats. Additionally, our examination of the infrastructuring of identification has highlighted a gap in research regarding the implications of identifying people across complex data infrastructures. It is within this context that the significance of data matching emerges, as a pivotal process in identification and data management that enables the linkage and correlation of identity data across diverse datasets. Despite its widespread use and impact, further research is required to explore the intricate dynamics and implications of data matching, particularly in the context of emerging technologies, transnational infrastructures, and evolving security concerns. This dissertation aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the role and influence of data matching technology on the interpretation of data, operational practices, and organizational structures.

Based on these gaps identified in the literature review, we can now formulate the following main research question:

> How are practices and technologies for matching identity data in migration management and border control shaping and shaped by transnational commercialized security infrastructures?

This question focuses on the specific contexts of migration management and border control, which concern transnational security infrastructures. The question also highlights the reciprocal relationship between identity data matching practices and technologies and the broader context of transnational security infrastructures. The resulting research question highlights the importance of understanding the complex interplay between identity data matching, population management, and transnational security infrastructures in migration management and border control. The research question also suggests looking into the implications of these reciprocal relationships for understanding the broader social, economic, and political implications of identity data matching.

### Sub-research question

A range of sub-research questions that delve deeper into the complex relationship between identification systems and transnational security infrastructures can help to answer our main research question. To this end, the research is structured around three sub-questions that investigate the types of knowledge embedded within data models used by national and transnational security infrastructures (RQ1), the processes and technologies used to search for and match identity data across different organizations (RQ2), and the circulation of knowledge and technology related to matching identity data across organizations (RQ3). Addressing these sub-questions not only illuminates previously unexplored aspects of identification internationalization, commercialization, securitization, and infrastructuring but also contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of how identity data is managed and linked within transnational security infrastructures. The three research questions are as follows:

* RQ1: Which types of knowledge and assumptions about people-on-the-move are inscribed in data models of national and transnational security infrastructures? What implications does this have for how organizations can search and match identity data?
* RQ2: How do organizations that collect information about people-on-the-move search and match for identity data in their systems? How is data about people-on-the-move matched and linked across different agencies and organizations?
* RQ3: How does knowledge and technology for matching identity data circulate and travel across organizations?

The research questions posed in this dissertation aim to investigate how knowledge and data about people-on-the-move are matched and linked in transnational security infrastructures. The first research question (RQ1) seeks to uncover the types of knowledge embedded within data models used by different organizations and authorities — what @pelizzaScriptsAlterityMapping2023 have called “scripts of alterity” — and to understand how such organizations search for and match data related to people-on-the-move. Hence, this research question draws inspiration from the technical process of schema matching used in data matching, and it seeks to explore its implications for organizations' ability to search and match identity data. For instance, identifying records that refer to the same person could be challenging without knowledge of the underlying data models of the datasets being matched because the same person may be represented differently across datasets. In this way, this research can shed light on the internationalization of identification by looking at connections between the information about people-on-the-move gathered by various organizations.

The second research question (RQ2) focuses specifically on the ways in which organizations search for and match identity data related to people-on-the-move. This research will explore the processes and technologies used to link and match data across different agencies and organizations, and examine how identity data is collected, stored, and analyzed. By analyzing how data is matched and linked across different organizations, this research can help us better understand the challenges and opportunities associated with managing data related to people-on-the-move. Furthermore, this question can shed light on how emerging and commercially deployed international identification technology shapes state practices. Focusing on practices and devices may also provide evidence of possible securitization of identification.

Finally, the third research question (RQ3) explores how knowledge and technology related to matching identity data circulate and travel across organizations. This research will examine the networks of actors and organizations involved in developing and disseminating technologies used for matching identity data and explore how knowledge about such technologies is shared and disseminated among different actors and organizations. Answering this question can aid in our understanding of the broader social and political contexts in which identification technology is developed and used to have long-lasting effects in numerous locations by examining the circulation of knowledge and technology related to matching identity data.
