## A conceptual framework for analysing data matching in distributed settings

Following the overview of existing work and the gaps in their methods, I now put forward a conceptual framework for tracing data matching practices and technologies in transnational security data infrastructures. Such a framework is needed since no single method or theory can easily be adapted to examine these multiple facets of data matching practices and technologies within and across organizations. In this section, I therefore propose a conceptual framework that amalgamate established methods and perspective into one framework that guides the research in examining these multiple facets. The conceptual framework, in essence, integrates more technical computer science perspectives and techniques on linking and matching data models and records, with social science perspectives originating primarily in fields associated with Science and Technology Studies (STS).

As previously said, for government agencies, business, and other organizations the tasks of finding records in databases that refer to the same person can be important in many situations. As such organizations and agencies have been collecting ever more data about people, they may perceive performance benefits of having complete and accurate information about people, or even as beneficial to national security. The techniques to do these kinds of data matching are therefore well established. However, the creation, development, and consequences of deploying technologies for accomplishing such data matching is less well understood. With the framework that I outline in this section I propose to trace data matching practices and technologies as sociotechnical phenomena, and from four different angles: (1) how the kinds of information that is collected about people can be compared by looking at different data models and what this tells about the organizations, (2) how organizations search and match identity data, and which may have quality issues, (3) how such identity data is further matched between organizations, and (4) how, simultaneously with matching identity data, data matching technologies and practices travel and evolve across organizations.

To discuss these different aspects of analysing the matching of identity data, I propose to visualize the framework through several axes (Figure \@ref(fig:method-axes-visualization)). This visualization roughly follows a relational data model to represent data as tables that model relationships between data. The three axes capture the dimensions of the data which are: _data models_, _categories of data_, and _data values_. Next, I will describe how each of these different axes and the relations between them relates to different aspects of data matching within and across organizations.

```

To begin, the axis for _data models_ (axis `z`) represents the abstract models that standardize the kinds of information about people collected by different organizations. An example of such a data model would be the schemas specifying which data are collected about migrants by a government agency. Each organization might define its own data model, while some might share a data model to make interfacing between systems possible. Each data model specifies _categories of data_ (axis `x`) which are collected about people. For example, the categories of data of the asylum agency's data model may include "name", "place of birth", "date of birth". Finally, there are the actual _data values_ (axis `y`) in the systems' databases for the data model and its associated categories of data. For example, values for the category of data "place of birth" may be "Brussels".

That being so, I propose to schematize the three facets of data matching as combinations of pairs of these axes. In Figure \@ref(fig:method-axes-visualization), these three axes each zoom in on a particular facet of data matching within and across organizations.
