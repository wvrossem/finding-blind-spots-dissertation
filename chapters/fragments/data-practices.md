### Data practices and technologies in security contexts

While the impact of new information technologies on the workplace has been the subject of long debates in fields such as CSCW [see for example, @bowkerSocialScienceTechnical1997; @leonardiMaterialityOrganizingSocial2012; @orlikowskiSociomaterialityChallengingSeparation2008; @pollockSoftwareOrganisationsBiography2009], only recently these effects have started to gain more attention in practices of migration and border security. In essence, many theories and frameworks have examined and theorized about technologiesâ€™ (in)ability of transforming organizations and the coordination of work [@pollockSoftwareOrganisationsBiography2009]. While some scholars have theorized the introduction of information technology as a force of organization change [e.g., @kallinikosWorkControlComputation2009], others instead emphasized the struggles encountered by actors of fitting global software to local circumstances [e.g., @hansethDevelopingInformationInfrastructure1996]. In addition, social constructivists have stressed the tentative meanings and specific contexts and actors in which artefacts emerge [@jacksonSocialConstructionTechnology2002; @pinchTechnologyInstitutionsLiving2008]. Critical studies of technological innovations and knowledge practices in migration management, borders, and security have thus also incorporated these aspects when examining how devices, practices, actors are mutually constituted and entangled.
