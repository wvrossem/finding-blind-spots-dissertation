# Font and back end/office

<!-- Software architecture -->

Managing and cleaning the data so that they can be used by others is often part of the back office; the part of an organization where administrative and logistical work is performed to perform service or products, but who do not deal directly with customers of that service or product. This back office work of data management closely relates to what @goffmanPresentationSelfEveryday1959 calls the ‘back stage’ of social life. This metaphor from the world of theatre highlights the impression management of actors and institutions. A database should give the impression that it is accurate and complete for the people interacting with it. Nevertheless, the backstage work of cleaning messy data should likely not be visible to those users. Moreover, automation of such tasks and processes may start and be more prominent at the back office [@snellenBlurredPartitionsThicker1992].

A similar analogy applies in software parlance, where the concepts of front and back end of a computer system are used to indicate a ‘separation of concerns’ between the presentation of the application that is accessible to the user (front end), and the back end that performs operations invisible to the user such as data access. This design criterion of separation of concerns is a well-establish and influential. It emphasizes a modular way of designing software by separating and encapsulating different functions of a system (i.e., ‘concerns’), as a type of ‘divide and conquer’ strategy to manage the complexity of software development [@laplanteWhatEveryEngineer2007]. Yet not much reflection is given by engineers on the effects of such designs.

Of course, the distinctions between front and back office/stage/end depends on positioning. One person’s front can be the back of another. But what these metaphors and analogies show evidence of is the often implicit assumptions about how this kind of work should be made (in)visible. Such assumptions are furthermore materialized and made durable in the actual systems that are created to support these tasks. In order to understand these effects we therefore need to pay close attention to the design and uses of the technological artefacts.

Processes and practices of managing data can furthermore be considered as articulation work, which CSCW scholars have shown is crucial for collaborative work. In this view, it is the background or invisible work for making other things work smoothly. Such ideas are also evident in the metaphors and expectations surrounding the work of managing data; further shaping how this work is valued and made (in)visible [@dignazioDataFeminism2020]. Metaphors and work titles used for the kind data management — such as ‘data cleaner’ or ‘data janitor’ — underline how such metaphors even have gender and class connotations. Infrastructure scholars in particular however have shown that what counts as work depends on the context and definitions in which it is done [@starLayersSilenceArenas1999]. Data management activities are therefore not inherently visible or invisible. Rather, by taking serious technologies for using and managing data it is possible to see the particular expectations and values they embed; for example making such work more or less visible.

## Data cleaning

Second, the organization and architecture causes some data cleaning efforts to be kept at the backstage. This can most clearly be seen in the example of deduplication, where the automatic query periodically finds possible duplicates which are processed by one unit in the organization. Nevertheless, interview participants explained that the process for deciding on resolving a possible duplicate match evolved over time. With the addition of standard reasons and justifications for resolving duplicates, and additional documentation the work has become more traceable. However, for a record presented in the interface to an IND employee, it may not be apparent that any of this work has been performed on a record. The relation between visibility and invisible work thus operates as a ‘matrix’ [@starLayersSilenceArenas1999] where different technical and organizational choices make some things more or less visible.
