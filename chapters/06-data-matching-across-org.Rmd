## Introduction

What we know about technologies for identifying people is strongly related to how we know the devices and practices involved.[^paraphrase] For example, every year authorities identify millions of people crossing the EU external border; people migrating to and from the EU, visiting as tourists, or seeking asylum. To do this identification, authorities will link and cross-check personal data from various databases to help identify people. For instance, to verify identities for visa applications, to detect identity fraud by linking identities across national and international policing systems, or to match flight passengers' personal data against government watch lists. These processes play a role in furcating mobilities — speeding up, slowing down, excluding some forms of mobility [@sparkeNeoliberalNexusEconomy2006]. But, what do we know about the systems that progressively carry more weight in establishing someone's identity, and how do we know the technologies?

[^paraphrase]: In this sentence I paraphrase a more general insight of @pollockSoftwareOrganisationsBiography2009: 'What we know about technologies, their innovation processes and outcomes is closely bound up with how we know them.' (p. 51)

Researchers can bring in to focus a number of moments in the lifecycle of technologies of identification thus giving specific perspectives on the technologies and their related practices. Moving backwards in time we might focus on different moments and locales: from operation and maintenance of sociotechnical systems of identification to initial phases of their conception. At airports, for instance, we might observe the choreography required between border agents and devices to identify travellers with automated borders systems using their biometric passports [e.g., @lisleManyLivesBorder2019]. Shifting attention to back office systems supporting border management might foreground everyday activities to maintain and operate large information systems and difficulties of dealing with incomplete or inaccurate to identify persons [e.g., @bellanovaControllingSchengenInformation2020]. Or, the processes of developing systems could be traced by following actors and reviewing proposals: from initial steps policymaking in establishment of policy such as the EU 'smart borders' package [@bigoJusticeHomeAffairs2012a; @jeandesbozSmarteningBorderSecurity2016] to the design of a something like the EU Visa Information System [@glouftsiosDesigningDigitalBorders2019]. Selecting between one or more of these moments in the lifecycle of a sociotechnology of identification (e.g., planning, analysis, design, procurement, implementation, operation, maintenance) and disregarding others will unavoidably lead to partial descriptions [@pollockEInfrastructuresHowWe2010].

Those moments are not self-contained, but rather contain interconnected and contingent aspects of the lifecycle of sociotechnologies of identification. For example, research design focusing on practices of biometric identification might miss how various actors mediate and intertwine with identification, just as EU Member State fingerprinting software are made to comply with US standards [@pelizzaProcessingAlterityEnacting2019]. Alternatively, taking proposals and technical design specifications as a starting point of inquiry might miss the intricacies of adopting technologies to particular locales. Taking into account all moments and actors is of course impossible, so researchers need to weigh and make explicit their choices through an understanding of the field and the research objectives.

The choices researchers make can have real effects since it is by now widely accepted that research methods play an active role in bringing into being phenomena they set out to describe and discover [@lawEnactingSocial2004]. Methods can, according to this view, be thought of as devices that bring together bits and pieces of the world to enact certain realities. The question therefore has come to be in which 'ontological politics' (sic.) researchers are involved in and what realities they help make. There are, for instance, important reasons to make migrants' practices and experience a starting point to understand forms of discrimination and unpredictability ingrained in sociotechnologies of identification at the border. Yet, such focus also might make one oblivious to the fact that a small oligopoly of technology companies and IT consultancy companies are dominating the development of technologies for identifying people [@lemberg-pedersenPoliticalEconomyEntry2020; @jonesFundsFortressEurope2022]. There is thus always a risk to be, perhaps as Franz Kafka's protagonist K. in his novel _The Castle_, stuck outside _Fortress Europe_ without knowledge of its inner workings. At the same times, the tropes of fortification and securitization might obscure disparities between experiences at the border. If methods are not innocent, the choice of what to include in research designs is also political.

In this article I review strand of research that have scrutinized sociotechnologies of identification in EU migration and border control. While many scholars have highlighted materiality and performativity of devices and practices, they tend to stay rather implicit on their methodological choices in their accounts. I therefore compare these strands of research with principles and concepts formulated by approaches in STS which have provided suggestions to common research designs on how to best study complex data infrastructures, such as those involved in practices of identification. While those researchers have somewhat different aims in understanding sociotechnical change and innovation practices, I argue that their propositions provide useful heuristics to understand current (sometimes implicit) methodological choices in research on technologies of border and migration control. After reviewing related work, I reflect on these challenges with some of my fieldwork findings and by presenting a few key 'biographical moments' [@glaserBiographyAlgorithmPerforming2021] of a software package that is entangled in identification at EU and Member States. These moments are surely not aimed to provide a somehow better picture, but rather as examples of what can be gained by taking into account lesser known actors and aspects of the lifecycle of sociotechnologies of identification.

## Related work

Ongoing scholarly debates in the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) about the intertwining of methods and outcome of investigations may have implications for research conducted on technologies at the border. Broadly speaking, the debate has called attention to a discrepancy between research designs concerned with sociotechnological and the knowledge that technologies are shaped, over time, in multiple context and by various actors [@hyysaloMethodMattersSocial2019; @silvastTheorymethodsPackagesScience2021]. On the whole, this scholarship asserts that many inquiries omit these insights on the multiple and contingent life of technologies by limited research designs, and provides recommendations for ameliorating research. This assessment is not insignificant, especially when combined with the insight that methods do not merely describe the world but are play a role in enacting particular realities [@lawEnactingSocial2004].

Several principles and guidelines can be deduced from this scholarship [@hyysaloMethodMattersSocial2019; @karastiStudyingInfrastructuringEthnographically2018; @silvastTheorymethodsPackagesScience2021], which can serve as heuristics to understand what is present and what is missing from debates on sociotechnologies of identification in border and migration management. To begin, technologies for identifying people at the border are part of larger data or infrastructures. As part of distributed infrastructures their development, deployment, use takes place within settings with many dimensions and interconnected actors which poses particular challenges on how to study these complex phenomena. One recurring recommendation is to focus on moments and sites where multiple of such actors affect each other. Ideally, research should then take account of sufficient of such moments to understand the extent of change across localities and temporalities, and to have accounts that take into account a diversity actors. Following this line of research, technologies are not assumed to be stable but are enacted differently across multiple contexts. For instance, the same biometric identification system deployed at an airport may not have the same meaning when deployed at a difficult land border.

For a number of years, researchers in fields such as migration and security studies, International Relations have drawn from concepts, theories, and methods from STS to study sociotechnologies of identification in border and migration control. The question remains of how these authors have integrated those same insights into their research problems and designs. Surveying the landscape of research on sociotechnologies of identification would help in identify prevailing problematizations of sociotechnologies of identification and the methodologies employed by researchers. As a representative case, I am especially interested research investigating the European information systems in the area of Justice and Home Affairs (JHA), and closely related developments. These include systems that, combined, contain millions of personal data on third country nationals to identify persons and control their movements to and within the European Union. As such, these JHA information systems have been widely researched from a multitude of angles.

### Similarities and evolutions in body of literature

One well known way to survey a landscape of research is by analysing the co-occurrences of words in the titles, abstracts, keywords of scientific outputs. Co-occurrence analysis premises that extracted words and phrases can represent specific problems, topics, themes, concepts, and directions of a field of research [@callonTranslationsProblematicNetworks1983; @mingersReviewTheoryPractice2015]. The innovativeness of this approach, pioneered by @callonTranslationsProblematicNetworks1983, is that it provided empirical results to show how researchers are not independent of their socio-political context in defining research problems and applying actions or methodological strategies. In the tradition of what later would be known as actor-network theory, the authors treated scientific outputs as 'literary inscriptions which make use of words as translation operators to define a problem and establish its relationships with a series of other problems' (p. 226). In this way, scientific texts can be conceptualized as 'devices' that channel interest to have a particular effect and possibly transforming the field of research. Analysing co-occurring words (and phrases) in a corpus of scientific outputs can therefore be used to examine translations of research problems and the concepts, theories, methods mobilized. In the next subsection I will follow up on why we may also be interested in differences.

Operationally, a co-occurrence or co-word analysis works as follows. When two terms occur in a same piece of text they are considered related; when this occurs among a collection of pieces this can indicate that these terms are related to certain research topics. Groups of such connected co-occurring terms can further indicate relations between different topics. This network topology can also be visually analysed using different layouting algorithms that position the terms as connected nodes based on their relation to each other. These days, exports from citation and abstract databases can be used in software tools such as VOSViewer[^vosviewer] or Bibliometrix[^bibliometrix] to extract terms, and construct and visualize co-occurrence networks.

[^vosviewer]: <https://www.vosviewer.com/>

[^bibliometrix]: <https://www.bibliometrix.org/home/index.php>

Practically then, querying major citation and abstract databases[^dbs] can be used to get a sizeable corpus of this body of scientific literature. In this case, I found more than three hundred articles mentioning the EU information systems and related developments in the abstracts, titles, keywords of social science articles and books (see Query). The query results include, among others, articles from journals such as the 'Journal Of Ethnic And Migration Studies' (11), 'Security Dialogue' (7), Journal Of Borderlands Studies (6), 'Environment And Planning D Society And Space' (4), 'Geopolitics' (4).  Next, extracting and visualizing commonly co-occurring terms in the titles and abstracts of this corpus gives initial insights into problems, topics, themes, concepts, and directions of this field of research.

[^dbs]: For this analysis, I used the Scopus and Web of Science core collection. The web based services each provide access to multiple databases containing comprehensive citation data for many academic disciplines.

```{text query}

  OR  TITLE-ABS-KEY ( "entry*exit system"  AND  "EES" )
  OR  TITLE-ABS-KEY ( "Schengen"  AND  "SIRENE" )

)
```

The process of extracting and grouping co-occurring terms identified three clusters which are frequently present among scientific outputs in the corpus (Figure \@ref(fig:eu-systems)). In the first cluster (leftmost and coloured green in the visualization) there are topics related to the different JHA information systems and their databases: Eurodac, the Schengen Information System, the Visa information, and the forthcoming framework to make these systems interoperable. The size of the nodes — indicating the frequency of the terms — are similar, so all systems seem to receive as much attention in the body of literature. Although, it should be noted that, because systems have been incrementally added over the years, there may be a slight predisposition towards researching the newer systems. In the same cluster we can see that some terms and concerns are more legalistic, such as, with respect to the regulations establishing these systems, or problematizing the systems regarding data protection, privacy, and human rights.

```{r eu-systems, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A network visualization of co-occuring terms in the titles and abstracts found through a Scopus query for research related to the EU JHA information systems."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/vosviewer/co-occurrence-text.png")
```

The top and middle, blue cluster relates to a common research interest in the biometric identification that are part of the systems. More specifically, the focus is more often on fingerprints — as opposed to other biometric modalities. The links with terms relating to the different systems shows that the biometrics of the Eurodac and Visa Information System are mentioned more frequently. This is likely because, while the Schengen Information System also contains biometric data, its 'Automated Fingerprint Identification System' has only been added rather recently (March 2018).[^sisii] A question would therefore be to what extent research keeps up with new developments to existing systems. By looking at what is missing in these clusters, there seems to be a more general bias in research for addressing the biometric data stored in the system, rather than biographic/alphanumeric data (e.g., name, nationality, date of birth), and possibly equating biometric identification with identification (Figure \@ref(fig:identity)).

[^sisii]: See <https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/policies/schengen-borders-and-visa/schengen-information-system_en>.

The rightmost, red cluster then includes different processor, actors, methods, theories of research. For example, there are terms related to the governance, institutions, policies of migration and borders. Terms such as 'migration management' also seem to be often problematized as 'security technology' or 'surveillance technology'. A closely related term 'border regime' is closely connected to the concept of 'power', which seems to indicate problemitizations of power relations. Next, there are terms related to kinds of people affected by the technologies: 'migrant', 'refugee', 'asylum seeker'. What is less problematizated seems to be other kinds of people whose data is also present in the databases: travellers, missing people, criminals. Although the term 'work' is frequently used, the people working with the technologies do not seem to mentioned as frequently. For example, these could include border guards, police officers, visa issuing and migration authorities.

```{r identity, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A network visualization of co-occuring terms for the term 'identity'."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/vosviewer/identity-co-occurrences.png")
```

The third cluster also includes some terms related to the methods used by the authors (Figure \@ref(fig:eu-systems)). Regularly occurring terms related to the research design include 'case study' (12), 'fieldwork' (12), 'interview' (11).[^thesaurus] Other recurrent words such as 'discourse', 'comparison' seem to suggest they are linked to the method, yet their usages are, on closer inspection, primarily related to other aspects of the research. Important to note is that many abstracts do not mention their method in the abstract. A closer reading would therefore need to take into account the content of the articles to understand their employed methods. It seems that, for the most part, researchers stick to qualitative methods.

[^thesaurus]: During the process to extract key terms, a thesaurus is used to group related terms. For instance, terms such as 'field research', 'field study', 'field work' are considered as synonyms of 'fieldwork'.

[^automatic]: Although possible, it would be difficult to get reliable results from automatic methods to analyse complete articles to, for instance, identify commonly used methods. Text mining methods could be applied to extract and analyse the full text, but it would be difficult to distinguish between mentions of an article's method and those mentioned in other parts of the text (e.g., in a literature review).

### Differences and particularities in body of literature

Next to similarities, there are many distinctive features of research in the body of literature. In this section I will draw from the principles and guidelines deduced from STS scholarship and on how to study information infrastructures. These concepts can serve as heuristics to highlight key differences and particularities in literature on research related to the EU JHA information systems and their approaches to studying technologies and practices of identification.

#### Investigating the spatial and temporal reach of sociotechnologies of identification

The co-occurence analysis showed that the information systems and technologies are often problematized as part of a 'system', 'regime', 'infrastructure'. This observation resonates with how scholars empirically studying information infrastructures strive to trace and account for the multiple temporal and spatial scales at which systems operate [@hyysaloMethodMattersSocial2019; @karastiStudyingInfrastructuringEthnographically2018]. The question would therefore be of how to localize and study these complex phenomena. One way is through multi-sited ethnography approaches which assume that multiplying the sites of research can be used to give accounts of the connections and detail of distributed phenomena. For example, the 'Mig@Net-Transnational Digital Networks, Migration and Gender' project undertook a multi-sited ethnography approach of European border policies and practices by combining sites and contexts in Europe [@tsianosTransnationalMigrationEmergence2010]. The team of this two-year transdisciplinary research project were able to triangulate observations from different locales (Greece, Germany, Italy) and from various actors (migrants, policy experts). By combining observations regarding the Eurodac system from different sites they could show discrepancies in the categorizations of asylum seekers.

Broadly speaking, the Eurodac system assigns one of three categories to asylum seekers based on if the person (1) applies regularly for internation protection, (2) is found crossing the border illegally, or (3) is found illegally present within a Member State. However, based on interviews with officials in 2011, they found that there exists national and institutional disparities in how these categories are used and interpreted. For instance, at the time, one of their interlocutors in Germany was puzzled about why Greece was mainly using the second but not the third category. This example also shows how method of combining observations from multiple sites can have a politics of counteracting views of borders as impassable and instead highlight inconsistencies and unpredictability of border and migration control.

<!-- This chapter too is written in the context of an interdisciplinary research project using a mix of quantitative of qualitative methods. -->

The method of multi-sited ethnography has traditionally been put forward to bridge distinctions between macro phenomena — lifeworld, regimes, systems, etc. — and local sites [@marcusEthnographyWorldSystem1995]. However, such dichotomies between micro and macro have been widely criticized by other scholars. According to Latour [@latourReassemblingSocialIntroduction2005], and actor-network theory more generally, a priori distinctions between micro and macro should be avoided since 'scale is the actor's own achievement.' (185). Another approach is therefore to "localiz[e] the global" [@latourReassemblingSocialIntroduction2005, p.173] by tracing the 'connections leading from one local interaction to the other places, times, and agencies through which a local site is made to do something' (173).

For instance, @pelizzaIdentificationTranslationArt2021 has traced how requirements for incorporating FBI standards for biometric identification in devices used at the Hellenic border "create trans-national associations with the EU Commission, corporate contractors and the US security regime". @donkoMigrationControlLocal2022 have shown how European migration management technologies for identification moves beyond the external borders of the EU. Through an ethnographic account the authors explain how border posts at the border between Burkina Faso and Niger is connected to EU agencies such as European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) through border management information systems of the IOM, to capture people's biographic and biometric data. Furthermore, the EU-funded West Africa Police Information System connects these border posts to all member countries of INTERPOL global policing communication system. Avoiding dichotomies of scale therefore makes it possible to observe the emergence of new and different topologies of relations between actors.

The spatial and temporal reach of sociotechnologies of identification does not mean that these technologies are necessarily stable, but rather their enacted across contexts is manifold. @soysurenEuropeanInstrumentsDeportation2022, for instance, took a comparative approach to compare the implementation of the Dublin III regulation (of the Eurodac system) between a founding EU member (France) and an associated country (Switzerland). They found that France took a more sceptical and decentralized approach in the use of the Dublin system for deporting people, whereas Switzerland eagerly took up the system and deployed in a highly centralized manner. In this way, their comparison shows how even a single European instrument can have different meanings and be put differently into practice.

A final point related to the temporal and spatial aspects is how research addressed change across time. First, the under-representation of the biometric aspects of the SISII systems, for instance, showed how research can lag behind, or perhaps understate the evolution of the information systems. Second, there is also a bias towards only focusing on successful projects and not taking into account failures. For example, the project of the second version of the Schengen Information System (SISII), encountered substantial difficulties: 'delays, an escalating budget, political crises and criticisms of the new system's potential impact on fundamental rights' [@parkinDifficultRoadSchengen2011, p.1]. This deficit in research stands in contrast to e-government and information systems literature more broadly, where failures have been long-standing concern due its high stakes and use of public money [@pelizzaBirthFailureConsequences2018].

#### Delineating the ecologies of interlinked actors

The co-occurrence of terms for the kinds of people mentioned in research shows that mainly certain kinds of people are mentioned in the corpus: 'migrant', 'asylum seeker', 'refugee'. The 'Autonomy of Migration' approach, for instance, takes migrants' practices of subverting and appropriating mobility regimes as a starting point and in opposition to the Fortress Europe discourse [@scheelAutonomyMigrationAppropriating2019]. This image of migration and border controls as fortifications has been criticized as favouring a security and control narrative that excludes the multiple practices and experiences of borders and migration [@mezzadraBorderMethodMultiplication2013] and a favours a paternalistic image towards migrants as powerless and in need of aid. By focusing on migrants' experience authors in this scholarship aim to destabilize these tropes by showing migrants' capacities to subvert and get round restrictive mechanisms of migration and border control.

Focus on moments and sites in which various actors interlink and affect each other, in order to arrive at balanced and appropriate accounts of the different actors. A closer look at literature shows that researchers tend to focus on specific actors: from interviews with local administrators and officers of international organizations of migration centres [@pollozekInfrastructuringEuropeanMigration2019], to interviews with officials and experts from European and national institutions [@glouftsiosGoverningCirculationTechnology2018; @trauttmansdorffInfrastructuralExperimentationCollective2021]. Moreover, studies drawing inspiration from STS and ANT also stress the role of non-humans [@pollozekInfrastructuringEuropeanMigration2019].

The multiplicity of places and actors involved, as well as the specialized and closed nature of the work certainly does unfortunately create barriers for researchers. For instance, a report by the 'Advancing Alternative Migration Governance' project explains how the development of the EU information systems 'has been engineered in specialized and closed forums, such as expert workshops, task forces, technical studies, pilots, or advisory groups and technological platforms steering not just policies, but also the formulation of research and development priorities of funding programmes, like the FP7 and Horizon2020' [@jeandesbozFinalReportEntry2020, p.10].  The authors of the report remark that therefore certain aspects, and less visible actors, such as the influence of the 'financial dynamics' have remained under researched.

Next, I reflect on these challenges with some of my own fieldwork findings of a software package that is entangled in identification of people at EU and Member States.

## Biographical moments

In this section I will draw on findings from fieldwork I conducted at the supplier of a software package for matching data for identification in fields of migration, borders, security (WCC). As explained previously, one of the aims of the fieldwork was to trace different episodes of the development and deployments of the data matching software and compare deployments at EU and Member State systems. As such, the research was thought to provide insights into the heterogeneous set of actors involved in practices of identifying and circulating data about people on the move at the European border [@pelizzaProcessingAlterityEnacting2019].

Practically, I joined the company named WCC to investigate the design, use, and evolution of a software product dealing with data matching and data deduplication. As a temporary member of the team, I visited their headquarters in The Netherlands, had access to relevant documentation, carried out individual interviews with people from the company and the customers, and attended some of the team's joint meetings. 

Here, I will focus on the evolution of WCC's software system called the 'ELISE ID platform' (ELISE), deployed at the immigration and naturalization service of the Netherlands and the central system of the EU Visa Information System. The collected data I draw on include (1) field notes, document analysis on the package for data matching, (2) interviews with developers, sales, consultants at the supplier, and (3) participant observations at industry events. For analysing the fieldwork data, I followed standard methods for inductive coding and developing themes.

Briefly stated, the software provides advanced functionalities for searching and matching of information on existing databases. The novelty of the technology comes from using various kinds of fuzzy logic algorithms to search structured and unstructured data — taking into account that this data may be incomplete or inaccurate. Here, fuzzy logic refers to a form of logic in mathematics where truth variables are calculated in probabilities instead of only being "true" and "false". Consequently, search results in ELISE are returned as values indicating the probability that two sets of identity data can be considered identical — i.e., match. ELISE is thus designed to handle the difficulties of matching between personal data from different locales, scripts, cultural contexts, and so forth.

As opposed to the tendency to focus on biometric identification, this system is used primarily for identification based on alphanummeric data such as a person's name, date of birth, or nationality. From the 'Report on the technical function of the Visa Information System (VIS)' [@eu-lisaReportTechnicalFunction2020] we can learn that these kinds of searches are a significant portion of identification for the VIS. For instance in 2019, the report notes that the software accounted for 25 million alphanumeric searches. The high frequency of searches is also visible in the importance is given to average response time of searches (less than 0.8 seconds). The report further notes that this response time does not include retrieval of a visa application by its number or visa-sticker number, which has a slightly faster response time. That is, the aforementioned searches correspond to more ambiguous searches based on other alphanumeric data such as name, date of birth, nationality. So although biometrics are important, for a system such as the VIS, a search on, for example, biographic data from a passport is key.

The ELISE ID platform is also integrated with the systems of the immigration and naturalization service of the Netherlands (Immigratie- en Naturalisatiedienst, hereafter IND). The IND is responsible for, among others, processing the applications from people who want to stay in The Netherlands or who want to become Dutch nationals. Practically speaking, the IND information system leverages the ELISE ID platform to facilitate searching for applicant data against the biographic information in their back-office system and to deal with data issues such as duplicate records.

Following @glaserBiographyAlgorithmPerforming2021 I structure my findings as biographical moments in the lifecycle of the identity matching software that show the interconnected and contingent aspects of sociotechnologies of identification.

### Spatial and temporal reach of the software package

<!-- 
What deficit does it address:

- Evolving across time: upgrades, gaining new features.
- 
 -->

A first biographical moment is the translation and generification work that made it possible to transport the software package across contexts and organizations. The software for searching and matching data is in fact not only used for practices of identification in migration and border control such as the Visa Information System. The software is also deployed at public and private employment services to match job seekers with vacancies, and by government agencies involved identity and security. When the company was founded, the founders thought of the software as a generic database for matching different things. Their first customers included a broad range of domains; from matching people with houses, people with jobs, wine enthusiasts to wines matching their tastes, people with their ideal holiday booking.

Work was therefore required to translate and making generic such data matching across contexts and domains, leading to tensions in the development of the product. Some software functionalities, such as two-way matching between records, are actually not used in identity and security contexts. Such tensions can also be seen in the process of deploying and configuring ELISE at EU-VIS where advanced matching features are not used due to exact pre-defined requirements for the search to allow integration with Member State systems. This stands in contrast with the system at the IND where much more customization and discussions between the supplier and the customer to set up a suitable implementation could happen.

<!-- ### Biographical moment #2: Travelling data matching software -->

<!-- 
What deficits does it solve:
  - Technologies evolving accross space
  - Eurocentric or Member State perspective does not take into account global aspects of software development.

-->

<!-- - Evolving across space: moving between organisations -->
<!-- - Evolving across time: upgrades, gaining new features. -->

These moments of generification of the software package is related to how the software travels between organizations. For example, over time new version of the ELISE system were developed with new data matching possibilities. Customers then have a choice to upgrade their current version of the package and receive new updates. In this way, new knowledge and features about data matching could get transported across organizations. On the other hand, software suppliers also deal with issues when some features cannot easily be transported. This was visible during discussions on a problem with a new version of a component to query and resolve duplicates in the databases of the IND. The question that arose was if a custom-made solution should be built or a more standardized one that could be further sold at other customers. However, the problem faced was the difficulty of defining what can be considered a duplicate identity. Every customer will have its own definition and so the solution would not be easily transferrable.

A look at the 'Report on the technical functioning of the Visa Information System (VIS)' [-@eu-lisaReportTechnicalFunction2020] highlights some changes to this system between 2017 and 2019. In mid-2018 the licence of the ELISE search engine was updated to deal with an increase in records. In 2018 a series of webinars was organised by the agency to 'enhance best practice implementation and support the most recent developments' (sic, p. 9). One of these webinars dealt with the ELISE search engine, 'introducing available search profiles and how to use them effectively; providing an overview of the scoring and ranking mechanism of search results'. The rather mundane updates show how maintenance, upgrades, training are crucial to the functioning of the data infrastructures.

### Ecologies of interlinked actors — performing and defining data matching

Other important moments in the lifecycle of the package relates to how the company and its employees define and perform data matching expertise and how this feeds into procurement processes. For example, WCC often flaunts its success as one of the three 'Top Tier Vendors' [-@WCCWinsTop2011] of the MITRE challenge. The MITRE Corporation, a non-profit research organization for the US federal government, launched a challenge for individuals, companies, and researchers to develop the best possible 'multicultural name matching' software. 

The company did in fact score well [@WCCWinsTop2011], which further helped secure a partnership with Accenture to use ELISE for the central EU VIS system as a component to search and match for someone's visa data using alphanumeric data. This partnership further lead to a subcontractor role with Accenture for searching and matching biographical and biometric data in the UNHCR's Identity Management System. Moreover, this challenge shaped the second mentioned moment, as ELISE was updated with new name matching functionalities.

Sales pitches for the software package often focus on the vendor-neutrality when comparing their software to other vendors. The company also develops an PNR/API system, which also uses the ELISE for watchlist matching. In sales pitches the company's system is strategically compared against, for example, the United States Automated Targeting System – Global (ATS-G) Programme. My interlocutor described how they explain that while a country might choose to adopt the ATS-G as a PNR/API system, it can be considered a devil's bargain. The ATS-G system is provided free of charge by the US government, but countries in return have to agree to an ongoing data exchange with the US Customs and Border Protection. In this example, we can see political economy of data at work and how countries can become of a global US surveillance network. The software of WCC is, in this case, presented to potential customer of the WCC software as a way to retain control of their data.

Other examples of performing as 'thought leaders' in data matching can be seen in the sales and pre-sales activities of WCC. For instance, performing their authority in data matching expertise at industry conferences (eu-LISA), or their strategies regarding competitors. In this way, they perform a role in defining future data matching solutions such for the interoperability of EU systems.

## Conclusion

In this article I have explored the question if research on the materiality and performativity of sociotechnologies of identification to be more reflective and explicit of their methodological choices. The co-occurrence analysis and literature review show how there is a tendency for researchers to focus on either theoretical debates about the systems or localist studies of practices of identification. Through the biographical sketches I attempted to show the value of expanding the analytical focus. For instance, by taking into account other actors and moments in the lifecycle of devices that are rarely features, such as software suppliers and their role in processes of procuring or deploying systems. Importantly, the findings show how systems and practices of identification are rarely self-contained; software suppliers circulate and re-use the software packages, influencing practices of identification across many domains and locales.
