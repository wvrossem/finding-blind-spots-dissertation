The paper presents empirical research to explore one way in which migrants in Athens negotiate Eurodac; where alternative imaginaries informed ideas of ‘big’ and ‘small’ fingerprints, shaping interactions with the asylum service as well as secondary movement. I use Autonomy of Migration (AoM) theories to depict borders as places of ongoing conflict, subjectivity and transformation and introduce the work of Castoriadis’ social imaginaries and the radical imagination to explore migrants’ alternative imaginaries. I argue that these occur at points of friction, within the constraints of, and alongside, a dominant socio-technical imaginary driving the proliferation of biometric border controls. I believe this enables a deeper understanding of the autonomy with AoM theories. Here, autonomy is presented as instances of self-creation, spurred on through the radical imagination and shaping moments of uncontrollability, where the subjective dimension of migration informs both meanings of autonomy as well as alternative imaginaries. Ultimately, I argue that these practices seek to disrupt and challenge the dominance of biometrics as a signifier of control, identity and truth. © 2021 The Author(s).

In this way, we want to contribute to the politicization of the constitutive instability of an embodied identity, i.e. of an identity and above all a body, as it has been postulated – against the somatic identity criterion, so to speak, according to which “we are” our body – by feminists such as Elizabeth Grosz (1994) or Niamh Stephenson and Dimitris Papadopoulos (2006) and, for the field of Surveillance Studies, by Kirstie Ball (2005). In the first part of the text we take up three cases. They have occurred as a result of refugee movements into Europe from 2015 onwards and, for their part – as we will show, not at all rationally justified –, have been conjured up to create scandals and then used as arguments to promote both the social and political acceptance and the desirability of increasing data interoperability and extending the scope of application, as can be seen from the EURODAC amendment that is currently underway.

States provide migrants’ biometric data to transnational databases that are increasingly interoperable in the area of migration and crime control, to be accessible for state-based law enforcement actors. This article uses the case of Eurodac – a biometric database initially developed for migration control purposes – to explore the ongoing expansion of law enforcement access to the collected information for the purpose of crime control. The article studies how borders are selectively made permeable for biometric data flows in the light of “crimmigration” discourses. It combines insights from critical migration, border, and security studies that address the increasing overlapping of migration and crime control in policy discourse, law, and surveillance technologies.

Illustrated through an encounter between a migrant and the Visa Information System (VIS)–one of the largest migration-related biometric databases worldwide–the article’s first part outlines three implications of digitisation. We argue that the VIS assembles a set of previously unconnected state authorities into a group of end users who enact border security and migration management through the gathering, processing and sharing of data; facilitates the practice of traceability, understood as a rationality of mobility control; and has restrictive effects on migrants’ capacity to manoeuvre and resist control. Given these implications, the article’s second part introduces three analytical sensitivities that help to avoid some analytical traps when studying digitisation processes. These sensitivities take their cue from insights and concepts in science and technology studies (STS), specifically material semiotics/ANT approaches. They concern, firstly, the ways that data-based security practices perform the identities of the individuals that they target; secondly, the need to consider possible practices of subversion by migrants to avoid control-biased analyses; and finally, the challenge to study the design and development of border security technologies without falling into either technological or socio-political determinism. © 2020 The Author(s).

The entry ban entails that a non-citizen expelled from one member state is barred from returning to the whole Schengen area for up to five years, or longer in case of a threat to public policy or national security. The pan-European validity of the entry ban is ensured by an alert entered in the Schengen Information System (SIS).

This article describes the multiplicity and diversity of these instruments. To analyse them more clearly, it distinguishes three types: legal, organisational and technological. The article equally points to the increasing relevance of technological tools, especially the use of biometrics. It also looks at how a founding member of the EU, France, and an associated country, Switzerland, utilise these European instruments to deport foreigners by focusing on the Dublin III Regulation as well as the Eurodac database, jointly referred to as the Dublin System. Grounding on a comparative study combining documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews and participant observation, this article describes the similarities and differences in the use of the Dublin System in these two countries. Moreover, it also reveals these countries’ specificities with regard to the roles played by local and national administrative bodies, and associative actors. The paper ends by concluding that to fully understand the deportation process in the European context as well as in certain countries, a multifaceted approach is required to make sense of the various interactions taking place between local, national and supranational frameworks, actors and practices. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","biometrics; Deportation; Dublin Regulation; Eurodac; European Union; France; Switzerland",,"Soysüren, I.; Institute of Sociology, Switzerland; email: ibrahim.soysuren@unine.ch",,"Routledge",1369183X,,,,"English","J.

In this article, we critically evaluate that claim by developing a notion of deliberation along Habermasian lines, in which deliberation is understood as a process that induces negotiating partners to change positions through argumentation. Based on this conceptualization, we explore to what extent and under which conditions deliberation is likely to occur in intergovernmental settings. To that end, we analyse decision-making on the proposal to give law enforcement authorities access to the Visa Information System. We conclude that a ‘thicker’ conceptualization yields relatively few instances of deliberation. Moreover, we identify a number of specific conditions, and interrelationships between them, that are conducive to this kind of deliberation. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Constructivism; deliberation; European Union; Intergovernmentalism; Justice and Home Affairs (JHA); Visa Information System (VIS)",,"Lo Bianco, S.; Research Group Changing Role of Europe, Netherlands; email: s.lobianco@hhs.nl",,"Routledge",07036337,,,,"English","J.

The authors reveal the issues of using the Internet as a tool of the loyal border management of the united countries, ensuring the liberalization of the movement of factors of production through the creation of a single space of freedom, security and justice. The infocommunication technologies are researched as a management mechanism with regard to their influence on modern geopolitical, economic, and specifically industrial processes. The indicated approach is implemented simultaneously both as the management of the content of political relations and the management of their form. The Schengen border management information system is regarded as one of the most striking examples of the information technologies use in the political, economic, and specifically industrial sphere. The structure and legal mechanisms of this system operation are analyzed, on the basis of which the advantages and disadvantages of technological and legal nature are revealed. Special attention is paid to the analysis of the draft laws under development aimed at the improvement of the Schengen information system as an electronic technology for the automated border management of the pan-European space of freedom, security and justice. Among other things the authors have taken into account the latest changes in the legal regulation of the Schengen information system, which took place in October 2018.Taking into account the identified shortcomings in the functioning of the Schengen information system, the recommendations for their elimination are formulated. It is concluded that it is necessary to create a single European information portal in order to optimize the processing of data received from the different agencies. The general trends of the SIS II reform are the simplification and acceleration of the procedures, as well as the strengthening of the personal data protection. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Industrial economics; Information use; Security of data; Business management; Electronic technologies; Factors of production; Industrial processs; Information and Communication Technologies; Information portals; Management mechanisms; Security and justices; Information management",,"Shamne N.L.Malushko E.Y.","Institute of Physics Publishing",17578981,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Drawing from the tension between the EU’s attempt to achieve watertight border controls by means of biometric technologies, and migrants’ persistence to move to and live in the EU, the volume pursues two interrelated objectives: first, it studies the encounters between migrants and the Visa Information System (VIS), one of the largest biometric databases in the world, from the perspective of mobility in order to investigate how migrants appropriate mobility via Schengen visa within and against this biometric border regime. Second, it addresses criticisms of autonomy of migration in order to develop it as a viable approach for border, migration and critical security studies. Hence, the book is driven by two interrelated research questions: what does the assertion of moments of autonomy of migration refer to in the context of border regimes that use biometrics to turn migrants’ bodies into a means of mobility control? And how do migrants appropriate mobility via Schengen visa within and against biometric border regimes? This book will be of great interest to scholars in border, migration and critical security studies, as well as researchers engaged in citizenship studies, surveillance studies, political theory, critical IR theory and international political sociology. © 2019 Stephan Scheel.",,,"Scheel, S.; Sociology department, Germany",,"Taylor and Francis",,9781351977838; 9781138285361,,,"English","Autonomy of Migration?: Appropriating Mobil. within Biometric Bord.

Author believes that the system of EU legal acts regulating visa relations should be qualified as EU visa legislation, which is one of the elements of a larger system of legal acts in the field of freedom of movement of persons. The EU visa policy has two key areas: the establishment of a visa / visa-free entry regime; the establishment of the procedure and conditions for issuing short stay visas. The latter area also includes issues related to the functioning of the Visa Information System. Currently, the EU realizes the reform of the visa policy, which covers both its directions. The analysis of the ongoing reform shows that the EU, on the one hand, seeks to strengthen external borders by creating additional control mechanisms, and. on the other hand, as a compensatory measure, creates more comfortable conditions for the entry of frequent and law-abiding travelers. © 2018 Institute of Europe Russian Academy of Sciences.

The main finding is that a separate standard is not necessary; however, there is a need for setting minimum requirements, ensuring security of the information systems, that come with appropriate guidelines that help the member states to achieve the minimum requirements. The second finding is that there is a need for greater cooperation and an increased knowledge exchange of the methods used in the member states.

Schengen Information System (SIS) is a computerized information system on persons, stolen vehicles, and objects for the use of border control authorities, customs, and national police. It relies on increased policing behind borders and extensive cross-border police cooperation between Schengen members.

Changes in EU policies are not only the consequences of ‘grand moments’ of treaty and institutional changes. In order to identify and explain changes in everyday decision-making, one should complement the traditional strategic bargaining perspective on decision-making with a constructivist view on discourse or language as sources of change. With the insights of both constructivists and communication theorists, this study focuses on the identification of conditions and occurrences of deliberation in the daily running of decision-making in the EU that allow for changes facilitating the adoption of new policy instruments. In this light a study of two cases will be presented of which each has taken place in a different institutional setting.

The findings of this analysis will be compared to findings of another analysis.

Current debates on this issue have been largely restricted to a technologically determinist approach that reduces the focus to problems of data misuse and privacy, precluding other pertinent ethical and political concerns. In response, the article engages with Giorgio Agamben's elaborations on the concepts of biopolitics and exception as an alternative way of analysing the use of biometric technology in the governance of forced migrants. It begins with a critical overview of Agamben's conceptualization of biopolitics and the state of exception. It then considers the Eurodac database and the UK's asylum Application Registration Cards as examples to demonstrate how current policies of immigration control and border management are implicated in the logic of exception. It argues that illiberal practices, such as biometric profiling and fingerprinting of asylum seekers and their incarceration in detention centres, are being enforced upon certain groups in ways that render their exclusion from the official juridico-political structure as an 'inclusive exclusion'. Importantly, the function creep of biometrics is not to be understood as the turning of exception into the rule in a somewhat homogenous way, but more as a polysemic process, which involves different forms of discipline and control that are irreducible to one singular paradigm. © The Author 2013.Published by Oxford University Press.All rights reserved.","Agamben; Asylum; Biometrics; Biopolitics; ICTs; Refugees","asylum seeker; biometry; immigration policy; information and communication technology; national identity; political integration; refugee; social exclusion; United Kingdom","Ajana, B.; Department of Culture, United Kingdom; email: btihaj.ajana@kcl.ac.uk",,,09516328,,,,"English","J.

As its name suggests, the concept of autonomy of migration's core thesis proposes that migratory movements yield moments of autonomy in regards to any attempt to control and regulate them. Yet, the concept of autonomy of migration has been repeatedly accused of being based on and contributing to a romanticisation of migration. After outlining two advantages the concept of autonomy of migration offers for the analysis of biometric border regimes, I demonstrate that processes of biometric rebordering increase the warranty of the two allegations, which feed this major critique. Drawing on examples relating to the Visa Information System, I show that processes of biometric rebordering alter the practical terms and material conditions for moments of autonomy of migration to such an extent that it becomes necessary to rethink not only some of the concept of autonomy of migration's central features, but the notion of autonomy itself. In the final section, I therefore point out some directions to develop the concept of autonomy of migration as an approach, which is better equipped to investigate today's struggles of migration without being prone to the critique of implicating a romanticisation of migration. © The Author(s) 2013.","Autonomy of migration; biometric rebordering; securitisation; security dispositif; situated knowledge",,"Scheel, S.; Department of Political and International Studies (POLIS), Walton Hall, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, United Kingdom; email: stephan.scheel@open.ac.uk",,,03058298,,,,"English","Millennium J.

The current retrofitting and technological remediation of borders suggests their transformation away from static demarcators of hard territorial boundaries toward much more sophisticated, flexible, and mobile devices of tracking, filtration, and exclusion. Borders require the labor of software developers, designers, engineers, infrastructure builders, border guards, systems experts, and many others who produce the ""smart border""; but they also depend on the labor of ""data-ready"" travelers who produce themselves at the border, as well as the underground labor of those who traffic in informal and illegalized economies across such borders. Bordering increasingly relies on technological forms of mediation that are embedded within hi-tech, military and private corporate logics, but are also resisted by electronic and physical ""hacks"" or bypassing of informational and infrastructural architectures. In this paper we consider three socio-technological assemblages of the border, and the labor which makes and unmakes them: (1) the interlocking ""cyber-mobilities"" of contemporary airports including visual technologies for baggage, cargo, and passenger inspection, as well as information technologies for passenger dataveillance, air traffic control, and human resource systems; (2) the development of the Schengen Information System database of the EU, and its implications for wider migrant rights and internal mobility within the EU, as well as radical border media that have attempted to intervene in that border space; and (3) elements of the US-Mexico ""smart border"" regime known as the Secure Border Initiative Network (2006-2011), and those who have tried to tactically evade, disrupt, or undermine the working of this border. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","bio-informatics; mobility; security; smart border; tactical media",,"Vukov, T.; Department of Communication, , Quebec, Canada; email: tamara.vukov@umontreal.ca",,,10350330,,,,"English","Soc.

In the course of the article, I critically examine the European Union’s EUROSUR project, Frontex and its Eurodac system and Australia’s Migration Legislation Amendment (Identification and Authentication) Act 2004 in order to stage a comparison of the various modalities of statist visuality deployed by states in their biopolitical governance of irregular migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, and to bring into critical focus the often lethal effects of these regimes of statist visuality. I conclude by presenting a form of counter-visuality to the state’s way of seeing by discussing the work of the contemporary Moroccan-French visual artist Bouchra Khalili, whose Mapping Journey Project stands as an agentic resignification and reclamation of the fraught journeys of irregular migrants through the surveilled lands of the global North. © 2015 Routledge.

The entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam granted the European institutions a more prominent role in the drafting of policies regarding immigration, asylum and external borders management. However, the legislative texts only aim at a minimum harmonization of the member states policies. In fact, instead of a European asylum policy, what has emerged is a policy of non-access to asylum through a number of measures such as making visas compulsory to enter Europe, imposing penalties against carriers, or codifying the notions of ""safe"" countries and ""manifestly unfounded demands"". Rather than introducing a common policy, the Dublin agreements and the Eurodac data base have made it possible to send asylum seekers from country to country. Thus, European asylum policy shows little solidarity and benefits only the ministries of those countries which have elaborated an informal system as early as 1985 in order to stop welcoming asylum seekers. © 2013 Le Seuil.

However, despite hundreds of thousands of fingerprints being processed through this system each year, Eurodac has received only very little media attention. In Europe, much of the public debate about the use of biometric technologies for the purpose of automated personal identification is centered on the gradual introduction of new biometric passports. To view biometric systems as "" black boxes "" leads to erroneous conclusions about their effectiveness, both from a technophobic and a technophile point of view. Rather, on a technical, socio-economic and historical level, they should be understood as complex systems that integrate smaller computer systems which are being sold to state and private actors by different manufacturers. The use of biometric identification systems at national borders can be seen as being part of communicative processes in the negotiation of access to resources and power. And the technology itself is a disputatious actor not least because of its unavoidable measurement errors (though categorizable) and unpredictable interactions with human actors. Thus, political responsibility for who is and who is not granted access cannot simply be devolved unto biometric systems as allegedly infallible and unambiguous technical authorities.","Automation of border crossings; Biometric border control; Biometric identification; Biometric identity; Biometrics; Identity check; Identity control; Technology assessment",,"Knaut, A.; Institut für Informatik, Unter den Linden 6, 10099 Berlin, Germany; email: knaut@informatik.hu-berlin.de",,,03411966,,,,"German","Kriminol.

When Information & Communication Technologies (ICT) are involved, outsourcing becomes rather complex. In such cases, a clear definition of the processes to be implemented and a quality assurance monitoring system are crucial factors for success. In addition, globalization, world level financial instability and the need to adjust to evolving standards and requirements, compel Governments and Public Organizations to become more adaptable and to handle changes efficiently. This last constraint has a direct impact on the design of ICT systems; Business Process Modeling becomes mandatory as the most appropriate change management mechanism. In this paper, a new methodology is presented based on Business Process Modeling. Once the model is completed, the relative program code of the final system is produced. In addition to this system, an end-to-end monitoring platform is developed to continuously search, identify and assess technical and human deficiencies. This goal is achieved by following-up the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the processes, through the creation and management of adequate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Once the technical problems are suitably addressed, the focus moves to human skills and competency. In this case, clearly defined training needs can be covered adequately and the system can be used optimally. This new methodology has already been tested successfully on a simple Bank application, a short description of which is included in this paper.

This greediness indicates the distorting potential of information technology regarding the means-end logic. Our analysis suggests that the European migration policy is stuck in a 'digital fix', i.e. a technological fix focusing on ICT. We identify three political issues concerning greedy information technology within the context of the European migration policy.

Further, it is demonstrated that more thorough impact assessments could become the cornerstone for legal assessments of the application of data protection principles in individual biometric projects such as EURODAC. The conclusion is that the current approach to informational trends and biometrics will have to develop beyond personal data protection towards a more comprehensive notion of societal data protection through privacy enhancing data and identity management.

It was noted in that Report that the existing problems in judicial and enforcement agencies’ cooperation across the EU made the use of national criminal records as a means of combating organised crime rather problematic. It was pointed out that practical problems hindered the speed, access and effectiveness of existing methods of cooperation and the creation and use of an ECR was the way forward for the effective combating of organised crime. Of course, the idea of using databases as a means of combating crime is not new. Practically all enforcement agencies around the world use ‘files’ (in paper or digital form) on crimes, suspects and methods (modus operandi) in an attempt to prevent crime or prosecute criminals. In fact, in recent years digital databases such as the Schengen Information System (SIS) have become the first line of defence against transnational organised crime and plans to update and develop further the system into a SIS II are on the way. What makes the proposal for an ECR different is the idea of an EU-wide dedicated database which addresses the problem directly: in other words, a dedicated database which contains information extracted from national criminal records on selected crimes. © Cambridge University Press 2008 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",,,"Stefanou, C.; Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, School of Advanced Studies, University of LondonUnited Kingdom",,"Cambridge University Press",,9780511495069; 9780521866699,,,"English","Towards a European Criminal Record",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927004727

Steps in this direction have taken the form of initiatives aiming both at eliminating obstacles to the exchange of personal data between national authorities and at creating EU-wide structures and databases. The emphasis on developing EU-wide databases can be witnessed in both the immigration and asylum field (with the establishment of the EURODAC and Schengen Information System (SIS) databases and proposals to establish a Visa Information System (VIS) in the pipeline) and the criminal law/policing field (the Europol database and part of the SIS database being prime examples). Political reactions to terrorist attacks this decade have led to calls for increasingly linking these databases (notwithstanding their different purpose) and increasing their ‘interoperability’ – a strategy clearly visible in the 2004 Hague Programme, a five-year renewal of the EU Justice and Home Affairs strategy. The Hague Programme also calls for the further facilitation of bilateral information exchanges in the police field under the so-called ‘principle of availability’ and for the ‘deepening’ of surveillance by the use of biometrics in the various databases. © Cambridge University Press 2008 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",,,"Mitsilegas, V.; School of Law, Queen Mary, University of LondonUnited Kingdom",,"Cambridge University Press",,9780511495069; 9780521866699,,,"English","Towards a European Criminal Record",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84909422433

Specifically, I examine the expanding scope and implications of biometric surveillance technologies in liberal states’ border securitization practices. Since 9/11, biometric identification systems have been fast‐tracked as a “silver‐bullet solution” to address perceived threats to border security in the United States and the European Union. I argue that the deployment of new information and biometric technologies in the United States and the European Union is both individuating and expanding state space into new geographies (i.e., state control is extensifying inside bodies and reaching outside sovereign territorial boundaries). This is due, in part, to the deployment and growing interoperability of new border securitization technologies, like US‐VISIT in the United States and the second generation of the Schengen Information System (SIS II) and Visa Information System (VIS) in the European Union. Biometric systems augment efforts to create a high‐concept, multi‐layered, interoperable system of “virtual borders” designed to deter or intercept determined terrorists, criminals, and unauthorized migrants. As the deployment of biometric technologies creep from the margins to the mainstream, privacy and surveillance concerns will become evermore salient. Equally important are the implications of this incremental “disembodied integration” of people with states on how liberal bionetwork societies make decisions about belonging and exclusion.

Because borders and immigration policy alone cannot stop irregular migration, many governments turn to internal migration control on settled irregular migrants. Surveillance of this group is aimed at their exclusion from key societal institutions, discouraging their stay and ultimately, the deportation of apprehended irregular migrants. These are policies in which identification of irregular migrants is crucial. In this age, registration and identification mean computerized and networked databases. The member states of the EU are currently developing a network of databases in the field of (irregular) immigration. The Schengen Information System (II), the Eurodac database and the Visa Information System are vast databases, often including biometric data, aimed at controlling migration flows and identifying and sorting legal and irregular migrants. These systems are able to 're-identify' parts of the population of irregular migrants on the basis of digital traces of their migration history. It is argued that the digital infrastructure that is now growing past its infancy is developing into a formidable tool for the surveillance of irregular migrants in Europe. ©International Sociological Association.","Databases; European Union; Irregular migration; Social sorting; Surveillance",,"Broeders, D.; Erasmus University of Rotterdam, Netherlands; email: broeders@fsw.eur.nl",,,02685809,,,,"English","Int.

The right to move freely represents one of the fundamental freedoms of the internal market as well as an essential political element of the package of rights linked to the very status of EU citizenship. The scope ratione personae and the current state of the principle of free movement of persons is assessed by looking at the most recent case law of the Court of Justice and the recently adopted Directive on the rights of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States. But what are the hidden and visible obstacles to free movement of persons in Europe? How can these barriers be overcome to make free movement and residence rights more inclusive? This article addresses these issues along with the following questions: Who are the beneficiaries of the free movement of persons in an enlarged Europe? What is the impact of the recent legal developments in the freedom of movement dimension, such as the European Court of Justice case law and the new Directive? And to what extent are pro-security policies such as the Schengen Information System II and an enhanced interoperability between European databases fully compatible with the freedom of movement paradigm?. © 2017 Wiley.

It is based upon an analysis of special data records, including surveillance of national and alien suspects, asylum and deportations, 'border repulsion of undesirable persons', etc. provided to the press by the Greek Schengen Bureau. Some comparisons are made with other Schengen counterparts. The analysis illustrates those particular geopolitical and sociopolitical control imperatives that actually affect the efficiency of the Schengen Agreement in Greece. Based also on other documented evidence, I conclude that Schengen's impact is a mixed blessing for Greek and European citizens as regards both their free movement, and also potential violations of their privacy and civil liberties.

Rather than IT rendering the body irrelevant to identity -a mistaken idea to begin with -the coupling of biometrics with IT unequivocally puts the body center stage. The questions to be raised about biometrics is how bodies will become related to identity, and what the normative and political ramifications of this coupling will be. Unlike the body rendered knowable in the biomedical sciences, biometrics generates a readable body: it transforms the body's surfaces and characteristics into digital codes and ciphers to be 'read' by a machine. ""Your iris is read, in the same way that your voice can be printed, and your fingerprint can be read"", by computers that, in turn, have become ""touch-sensitive"", and endowed with seeing and hearing capacities. Thus transformed into readable ""text"", the meaning and significance of the biometric body will be contingent upon ""context"", and the relations established with other ""texts"". These metaphors open up ways to investigate the different meanings that will become attached to the biometric body and the ways in which it will be tied to identity.

This article will present a critical assessment of the operation of the Convention in light of State practice and case-law in Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom and provide some suggestions towards its improvement. The underpinning of the 'Dublin system' is the principle of authorisation, under which the State which has 'authorised' the entry of an asylum seeker on the territory of the Member State is responsible for examining his or her application. The Convention sets out objective criteria to determine the responsible State in accordance with that principle. Complex procedural rules have also been adopted to implement the Convention, including the draft EURODAC instrument which organises a centralised database of asylum seekers' fingerprints. Yet, various problems have appeared in the operation of the Convention. The scope of the Convention does not include applications for humanitarian protection, the conditions for family reunification are too strictly defined, and most importantly the difficulty of providing strong evidence of illegal entry into one of the Member States renders the Convention useless in many cases. The application of the 'opt-out' clause, which creates a derogation to the criteria determining responsibility, is therefore quite common in humanitarian and family cases, but is also used by the authorities of the Member States to ensure the swift expulsion of asylum seekers. The very basis of the system, the principle of authorisation, should also be re-examined by the Commission which will present a proposal of Community instrument based on the Dublin instrument in the near future.",,,"Hurwitz, A.; BA, Brussels, Belgium",,"Oxford University Press",09538186,,,,"English","Int.

But the existence of databases ranging from the relatively unsophisticated Schengen Information System and the proposed European Information System to the UCLAF system to combat fraud raises many legal and criminological issues. There is a danger that the database and profiling approach exaggerates the scale of organised crime to excuse unwarranted interference with civil liberties, and it is not easy to keep large databases secure from hackers. There is no proper mechanism for complaining about abuses, and there may be inadequate protection for political dissidents. On the other hand pooling of information enables the authorities to allocate scarce resources to the most harmful crimes and can help to minimise unwarranted invasions of privacy. National SIRENE bureaux provide judicial and administrative checks by filtering individual requests for information from databases, and safeguards have been built into the procedures for accessing the IRENE-3 database.
