This paper enhances the theoretical debate on migration with new ways of understanding borders and space as fluid, autonomous, and provisional linkages between humans and nonhumans. Based on findings from field research conducted in Greece, it aims to discuss how migrants' digital practices generate new spaces and materialities. Attending to the making of migrants’-ICTs intertwining it examines the emergence of unbordering practices, the creation of crucial solidarity networks and the risks and limitations that emerge when using ICTs. Finally, the paper highlights the recent migratory influx not simply as a result of neoliberal doctrines, but (also) as an act of disobedience to fortress Europe through the creation of digital-urban heterotopias through the lenses of Migration Studies, Science and Technology Studies and Critical spatial theory. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Heterotopia; ICTs; Migration; Multiple; Space","digital image; immigrant; information and communication technology; innovation; population migration; technological development; Greece",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agamben, G., State of exception (2005), University of Chicago Press Chicago; Alencar, A., Digital place-making practices and daily struggles of Venezuelan (forced) migrants in Brazil (2019) The SAGE handbook of media and migration, pp. 503-514. , K.

Drawing on both International Relations and criminology, it develops an analytical framework to identify the political rationalities and technologies of crime control that the EU attempts to transfer across the Eastern and Southern (extended) neighbourhoods. By scrutinising 216 projects aimed at combating transnational crime beyond Europe's borders, spanning law enforcement, border security, criminal justice, and the penitentiary sector, the empirical analysis is geared towards detecting and systematising the ways of thinking and doing crime control that the EU seeks to promote and export. Moreover, it investigates the 'action at a distance' whereby it does so. It is argued that in shaping third countries' ability to criminalise, police, indict, convict, and punish, the EU is simultaneously defining its own security actorness, specifically consolidating its role as a 'global crime fighter'.

However, although the continuously increasing number of visitors, entering the EU through land-border crossing points or seaports, brings immense economic value, novel border control solutions, such as mobile devices for passenger identification for land/sea border control, are essential to precisely identify passengers &#x201C;on the fly&#x201D; ensuring their comfort. Nevertheless, these devices are expected to handle highly confidential personal data and thus, it is very likely to become an attractive target to malicious actors. Therefore, to ensure high level of device security without interrupting border control activities, strong secure and usable user authentication mechanisms are required. Towards this direction, we, firstly, discuss risk-based and adaptive authentication for mobile devices as a suitable approach to deal with the security vs. usability challenge and a novel risk-based adaptive user authentication mechanism is proposed to address this challenge. Afterwards, a set of popular Machine Learning (ML) classification algorithms for risk-based authentication was tested and evaluated on the HuMIdb (Human Mobile Interaction database) dataset to identify the most appropriate ones for the proposed mechanism. The evaluation results demonstrated impact of overfitting (i.e., accuracy: 1,0000) and therefore, we considered novelty detection algorithms to overcome this challenge and demonstrate high performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that novelty detection algorithms have been considered for risk-based adaptive user authentication showing promising results (OneClassSVM 0,9536, LOF 0,9740, KNN&#x005F;average 0,9998).

Drawing on the concept of border performativity, this article discusses how data is transforming the border. In particular, the article focuses on 1) how the EU JHA databases are evolving, from separate systems each with one purpose to multi-purpose databases, and 2) how the new EU plan – the interoperability regulation – connects and merges biometric and biographical data, as part of a shift from a silo-based approach towards a single centralised information system. The article - based on results of several research projects carried out between 2011 and 2019 adopting mixed methodology - discusses the border crossers’ role in challenging this digital border control, both in light of the current practices of data collection and processing and newly approved EU regulations. The article argues that the transformation of border control practices into practices driven by data processing makes it more difficult for border crossers to manoeuvre the system and legally challenge decisions based on data processing, thus, hampering the transformation of the border from below. © The Author(s) 2022.","borders; crimmigration; databases; European union; technology",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aas, K.F., 'Crimmigrant' bodies and bona fide travelers: Surveillance, citizenship and global governance (2011) Theoretical Criminology, 15 (3), pp. 331-346; Aden, H., Interoperability between EU policing and migration databases: Risks for privacy (2020) European Public Law, 26 (2), pp. 93-108; Aliverti, A., Tracing imprints of the border in the territorial, justice and welfare domains: A multi-site ethnography (2019) Howard Journal, 58 (2), pp. 240-259; Anagnostou, D., (2014) Rights and Courts in Pursuit of Social Change: Legal Mobilisation in the Multi-Level European System, , Oxford, Hart Publishing; Anderson, B., Pre-emption, precaution, preparedness: anticipatory action and future geographies (2010) Progress in Human Geography, 34 (6), pp. 777-798; Andreas, P., (2000) Border Games: Policing the U.S.-Mexico Divide, , Cornell, Cornell University Press; Bigo, D., The (in)Securitization practices of the three universes of EU border control: military/navy - border guards/police - database analysts (2014) Security Dialogue, 45 (3), pp. 209-225; Birks, M., Mills, J., (2015) Grounded Theory: A Practical Guide, , London, Sage; Boehm, F., (2012) Information Sharing and Data Protection in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice – Towards Harmonised Data Protection Principles for Information Exchange at EU-Level, , Berlin and Heidelberg, Springer; Bordieu, P., Wacquant, L., (1992) An Invitation to Reflexive Sociology, , Chicago, University of Chicago Press; Bosworth, M., Border control and the limits of the sovereign state (2008) Social and Legal Studies, 17 (2), pp. 199-215; Broeders, D., The new digital borders of Europe: EU databases and the surveillance of irregular migrants (2007) International Sociology, 22 (1), pp. 71-92; Broeders, D., A European ‘border’ surveillance system under construction (2011) Migration and the New Technological Borders of Europe, pp. 40-67. , Dijstelbloem H., Meijer A., (eds), London, Palgrave Macmillian UK, In:, (eds; Broeders, D., Hampshire, J., Dreaming of seamless borders: ICTs and the Pre-emptive governance of mobility in Europe (2013) Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, 39 (8), pp. 1201-1218; Brouwer, E., Digital Borders and Real Rights.

This threatens visa-free travel, freedom of settlement and borderland economies in parts of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). It has interrupted historical mobility patterns, depleted the diversity of mobility practices and criminalized regional economies. At the same time, one can observe intensified and asymmetrical violent conflict in some of these borderlands. By taking the Kantchari-Makalondi borderland as a case study we analysed the relations between migration policies, insecurity, forced immobility and economic decline. Our observations and interviews with migrants, traders, security forces and borderlanders lead us to question conventional narratives on border control and African mobilities as a binary relation between Africa and Europe. Instead, they foreground the multiple practices of (im)mobility in these spaces: the circulation and blockage of travelers, merchandise, surveillance technologies, and military interventions and their impact on security and livelihoods. © 2021 The Author(s).

It argues that recent migration flows augmented pre-existing dynamics of growing reliance upon technology in EU border management. These dynamics are assessed through a study of the way emerging technologies, in particular Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV, commonly known as drones), and specific information and surveillance technologies installed on them, have become increasingly understood as crucial for the management of migration into the EU. The article synthesises securitisation theory with Science and Technology Studies to show, first, how the values reflected in border technologies often encapsulate a securitised understanding of the migrant, and second, how the migrants arriving in Europe have been characterised as both potential security threats and as individuals in need of rescue and protection. These frames trigger securitisation dynamics that portray the migration issue as amenable to state-of-the-art technology. In this logic, security ‘problems’ and security ‘solutions’ are co-produced within a complex multi-layered network of public and private actors. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","border management; drones; European Union; expertise; securitisation; Technology",,,,,,"787123; 262565","This work was supported by Norges Forskningsr?d [262565] and Horizon 2020 project Privacy, ethical, regulatory and social no-gate crossing point solutions acceptance (PERSONA), grant agreement ID: 787123.",,,,,,,,,,"Aradau, C., The Perverse Politics of Four-Letter Words: Risk and Pity in the Securitisation of Human Trafficking (2004) Millenium: Journal of International Studies, 33 (2), pp. 251-277; Baird, T., Knowledge of Practice: A Multi-Sited Event Ethnography of Border Security Fairs in Europe and North America (2017) Security Dialogue, 48 (3), pp. 187-205; Baird, T., Interest Groups and Strategic Constructivism: Business Actors and Border Security Policies in the European Union (2018) Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, 44 (1), pp. 118-136; Balzacq, T., Guzzini, S., Introduction: What Kind of Theory–If Any–Is Securitization?

Through the SIS II, national authorities exchange information about individuals and objects, and this across national and institutional boundaries. Yet, the SIS II does not always perform as anticipated in its design scripts. Following common threads about infrastructural politics across Science and Technology Studies, political geography and critical security studies, we explore fragility and maintenance as being intrinsic to the functioning of data infrastructures and crucial sites of governance. We show how the SIS II is kept under continuous control to operate as a controlling data infrastructure. This article contributes to a critical inquiry into the datafication of border controls by interrogating how data acquire the status of allegedly credible and accurate information. Ultimately, this approach pinpoints the inherent fragility of seemingly mighty data infrastructures and casts a light on those actors and processes that sustain, through maintenance, contemporary digital borders. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"border region; database; European Union; geopolitics; information system; police force; Europe",,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 682317; Leverhulme Trust: 2014-097; European Research Council, ERC; Università degli Studi di Trento, UNITN","Rocco Bellanova?s work was carried out in the framework of the research project ?FOLLOW: Following the Money from Transaction to Trial?, funded by the European Research Council, Grant No. ERC-2015-CoG 682317.

Funded under the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 programme, the system is analysed in relation to the wider political economy of ‘emotional AI’ and the history of deception detection technologies. We then move on to interrogate the design of iBorderCtrl using publicly available documents and assess the assumptions and scientific validation underpinning the project design. Finally, drawing on a Bayesian analysis we outline statistical fallacies in the foundational premise of mass screening and argue that it is very unlikely that the model that iBorderCtrl provides for deception detection would work in practice. By interrogating actual systems in this way, we argue that we can begin to question the very premise of the development of data-driven systems, and emotional AI and deception detection in particular, pushing back on the assumption that these systems are fulfilling the tasks they claim to be attending to and instead ask what function such projects carry out in the creation of subjects and management of populations. This function is not merely technical but, rather, we argue, distinctly political and forms part of a mode of governance increasingly shaping life opportunities and fundamental rights. © 2020 The Author(s).

Proposed by researchers at Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK, the iBorderCtrl project has been supported by a €4.5 million research grant under the Horizon2020 programme at the European Research Council. It continues a long-standing history of EU-funded security technology, not least in the context of border control and migration management, that has gained further prominence with the growing enthusiasm for the potentials of ML and AI. Significantly, there have been concerns about a lack of transparency surrounding the processes and details of the iBorderCtrl project, including ethics questions and the relationship between the research team and private companies on the project (Gallagher & Jona, ; Wilde, ).",,,,,,,,,"Altman, N., Krzywinski, M., The curse(s) of dimensionality (2018) Nature Methods, , May 31; Amoore, L., Doubt and the algorithm: On the partial accounts of machine learning (2019) Theory, Culture & Society, 36 (6), pp. 147-169; Benjamin, R., (2019) Race after technology: Abolitionist tools for the new Jim code, , Polity Press; Boffey, D., (2018) The Guardian, , https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/02/eu-border-lie-detection-system-criticised-as-pseudoscience, November 2, EU border ‘lie detector’ system criticised as pseudoscience; Bond, C.F., DePaulo, B.M., Accuracy of deception judgments (2006) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 10 (3), pp. 214-234; Browne, S., (2015) Dark matters: On the surveillance of blackness, , Duke University Press; Burr, C., Cristianini, N., Can machines read our minds?

My argument is that information systems do not always operate according to their design scripts. They materialize as unruly, unstable and failing infrastructures that are governed through maintenance in order to correct any identified functional anomalies and address potential future failures by adapting them to emerging technologies and the service needs of end-users (e.g. border guards, police). To conceptualize the maintenance labour through which information systems are governed, I synthesize ideas developed in Michel Foucault’s work on biopolitics and governmentality with contributions that explore the agentic forces and proclivities of technoscientific matter. By unearthing the very mechanics of maintenance processes, I make two contributions to the literature that interrogates the digitization and smartening of border security. First, I demonstrate that attending to maintenance permits a more complete understanding of the agency of information systems. Second, I broaden the research agenda that explores border security as practice by directing attention towards the often invisible, but politically significant, labour of maintainers who, by rendering information systems functional, sustain the power to govern international mobility by digital means. © The Author(s) 2020.","Border security; information systems; maintenance; Michel Foucault; New Materialisms",,,,,,"Leverhulme Trust: 2014-097; Università degli Studi di Trento, UNITN","The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research has been funded by the Leverhulme Trust (grant number 2014-097) and the School of International Studies at the University of Trento (project STERI: Science, Technology and International Relations).","I am truly grateful to Debbie Lisle, Rocco Bellanova and Peter Forman for their valuable feedback on previous versions of this article.

One of its central aims was, by predicting challenges related to increased migration, to improve resource allocation and prevent crime. By drawing on research on risk and threat assessment as a form of power, this article aims to analyze how risk categories are distributed and translated into a multilayered institutional arrangement where migration is policed as a potential crime. The article examines the indicators that the risk assessments are based on, and the measures applied and investigates how discretionary practices make immigrants objects for law enforcement and policing. The article contributes to research on migration control in an ordinary police context, where immigration identity checks become part of the crime reduction strategy. Applying the concept of interpretive flexibility (Collins 1981), I will identify the steps in this chain of translation to explore the leap from targeting potentially criminal asylum seekers to targeting broader groups with temporary residency in Norway. The article analyzes the conditions determining how policing, technologies, and migrants are ""co-constructed"" in a chain of mediation and translation, which reinforces the view of migrants as risky and criminal. The final section discusses how risk and threat analysis is affected by the notion of the ""crimmigrant other"" (Franko 2020). In Norway, selectively targeting unwanted migrants as criminals has become dominant in police decision-making at a policy level and everyday practices affecting not only third country nationals but also unwanted eastern Europeans. © 2021 Queensland University of Technology.

It presents empirical ethnographic evidence, gathered between January and June 2017, from Skaramagas and Elaionas camps in Athens. Although intended as temporary humanitarian solutions, many migrants have remained in them for long periods, stuck in a state of temporariness. Camps have been studied extensively through the lens of biopolitics as spaces of abandonment and abjectification. More recently, a growing body of literature is highlighting the everyday micro-politics and tactics of belonging that take place within them. Drawing on the latter, I shed light on the temporal aspects of border control involved in camps, arguing that camps provide a temporal, rather than only spatial, technology that governs encamped migrants through the administration of their time. Thus, the camp governs the critical moment between reception and in/exclusion from the polity. Yet, as I show, within this condition of semi-permanence and semi-presence, camp residents, through the practice of everyday life, being present and visible, create places and give new meanings to existing ones. If the border is enacted through the imposed temporalities of the camp, then its subversion can be found in these everyday place-making tactics. Looking into these micro-practices, this paper contributes to the above debates by exploring camps as temporal technologies of control. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Abandonment; Athens; Border temporalities; Borders; Camp geographies; Camps; Elaionas; Ethnography; EU border Regime; Everyday bordering; Governance; Micro-practices; Place-making; Resistance; Skaramagas; Subversion","border region; ethnography; European Union; governance approach; temporal analysis; Athens [Attica]; Attica; Greece",,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: 1632637","This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [Award Reference 1632637 ].",,,,,,,,,,"Abourahme, N., Assembling and spilling-over: Towards an ‘ethnography of cement’ in a Palestinian refugee camp (2015) International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 39 (2), pp. 200-217; Agamben, G., State of exception (2005), The University of Chicago Press; Agier, M., Between war and city: Towards an urban anthropology of refugee camps (2002) Ethnography, 3 (3), pp. 317-341; Agier, M., (2011) Managing the Undesirables: Refugee camps and humanitarian government, , Polity Press; Amilhat-Szary, A.-L., Giraut, F., Borderities and the politics of contemporary mobile borders (2015), Palgrave Macmillan London; Andersson, R., Time and the migrant other: European border controls and the temporal economics of illegality (2014) American Anthropologist, 116 (4), pp. 795-809; Arampatzi, A., The spatiality of counter-austerity politics in Athens, Greece: Emergent ‘urban solidarity spaces (2017) Urban Studies, 54 (9), pp. 2155-2171; Baumann, H., Moving, containing, displacing: The shipping container as refugee (2020) ShelterStructures of protection?

Information in its different forms, whether paper-based or digital, has always been fundamental to decision-making conduct. Concretely, the premise holds that decisions shall be based on correct, full, and adequate knowledge and reasoning. Technological innovation has, however, magnified information capacities and significance. The article in that respect maintains that the 'decisional value' of automatically-processed information consequently also alters the nature of the respective decision-making - from a conventional type where the agent exercises discretion to a 'semi-automated' conduct in which automation inhibits the agent's decision-making capacity. The recognition of such transformation is necessary for the law to keep up with the technological progress and safeguard rights of individuals who are subjects of such semi-automated decisions. © 2021 Uitgeverij Paris.

While respective research in the field of multimedia vision has been centred around improving quality and accuracy of identity recognition, the impact of such technologies upon society and legal regulations still remains a topic unaddressed, specifically within the engineering community. Research in technology can and in some respect must include collaboration with social sciences and social practice. Building on participation in the EU funded research project PERSONA [18] (Privacy, Ethical, Regulatory and SOcial No-gate crossing point solutions Acceptance), authors of this paper look at the challenges associated with biometrics-based solutions in no-gate border crossing point scenarios. This included the procedures needed for the assessment of their social, ethical, privacy and regulatory acceptance, particularly in view of the impact on both, the passengers and border control authorities as well as the potential pitfalls of biometric technology due to fraudulent activities. In consultation with the collaborating border control authorities, the paper reports on the formal assessment of biometric technologies for real-world acceptance to cope with the increasing demand of global travellers crossing state borders. © 2020, The Author(s).","Biometrics; Border security; Ethics; Impact assessment; Privacy","Biometrics; Laws and legislation; Multimedia systems; Philosophical aspects; Privacy by design; Biometric technology; Border crossings; Engineering community; Identity recognition; Legal regulation; Social acceptance; Social practices; State of the art; Social sciences computing",,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 787123; Horizon 2020","The work leading to this publication has been funded by the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No. 787123 (PERSONA RIA project).","The work leading to this publication has been funded by the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No. 787123 (PERSONA RIA project).",,,,,,,,,"https://gdpr-info.eu/; https://tractica.omdia.com/biometrics/in-biometrics-which-error-rate-matters/, Online, Available; https://www.khaleejtimes.com/news/general/soon-clear-immigration-at-dubai-airport-within-15-seconds; https://www.statista.com/statistics/273598/international-tourist-arrivals-in-europe/; (2006) Abinformatica, “abinformatica, , https://abinformatica.com.br/public/images/bodysearch2.jpg, Online, Available; Brownsword, R., Yeung, K., Regulating technologies: Legal futures, regulatory frames and technological fixes (2008) Hart Publishing; Carnevale, A., Will robots know us better than we know ourselves?

In the European Union (EU), this trend has been shown by the frequent overlap between asylum application and migration policies and the agenda concerning border control, security, and terrorism. This securitization of migration discourse is claimed to justify the use of controversial practices to examine asylum applications. Against this background, the article reflects on the use of technology-assisted and automated decisions in this area. In particular, it questions whether the existing safeguards provided in the EU data protection framework ensure asylum seekers' rights to privacy and the protection of personal data. In doing so, the article seeks to offer a more nuanced understanding of European asylum policy and the potential flaws therein that allow individuals' fundamental rights-enshrined in the EU Charter and the European Convention on Human Rights-to be infringed. In conclusion, the article engages with the debate relating to the use of automated decisions, in particular those based on artificial intelligence, and whether they should be excluded from certain policy areas, such as migration. © 2021 The Author(s).

The problems existing in the mechanisms of collecting biometric data of foreigners and stateless persons, as well as issues of personal data protection are considered. An attempt was made to suggest changes to laws and regulations in the field of migration and border protection on the basis of empirical data. The goal is to investigate the mechanism of identification of foreigners and stateless persons during border control procedures at border crossing points (checkpoints) and at entry-exit checkpoints, as well as during administrative proceedings and to identify ways to improve the legal regulation of these procedures in the activities of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine. The methods used in the research were the analysis and comparison of national legislation with the legislation of the European Union Member States and the Council of Europe (including the case law of the European Court of Human Rights) on biometric data. The questionnaire survey method enabled to obtain objective information about the border guards' awareness of personal data. The forecasting method was used to formulate proposals for amendments to the legislation to improve the organization of work processes in the activities of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine when using IT systems. The research will enable to improve the procedure for collecting biometric data of foreigners and stateless persons by border guards, strengthen the capacity of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine to combat illegal migration. © 2021, Bucharest University of Economic Studies.

A field in which this has become particularly salient is digitized EU border management. Here, the framework of responsible research and innovation (RRI) has recently been used to point to the alleged sensitivity of political actors towards the contingent dimensions of emerging security technologies. RRI, in general, is concerned with societal needs and the engagement and inclusion of various stakeholder groups in the research and innovation processes, aiming to anticipate undesired consequences of and identifying socially acceptable alternatives for emerging technologies. However, RRI has also been criticized as an industry-driven attempt to gain societal legitimacy for new technologies. In this article, we argue that while RRI evokes a space where different actors enter co-creative dialogues, it lays bare the specific challenges of governing security innovation in socially responsible ways. Empirically, we draw on the case study of BODEGA, the first EU funded research project to apply the RRI framework to the field of border security. We show how stakeholders involved in the project represent their work in relation to RRI and the resulting benefits and challenges they face. The paper argues that applying the framework to the field of (border) security lays bare its limitations, namely that RRI itself embodies a political agenda, conceals alternative experiences by those on whom security is enacted upon and that its key propositions of openness and transparency are hardly met in practice due to confidentiality agreements. Our hope is to contribute to work on RRI and emerging debates about how the concept can (or cannot) be contextualized for the field of security—a field that might be more in need than any other to consider the ethical dimension of its activities. © 2021, The Author(s).","Innovation; Responsible research and innovation (RRI); Science and technology studies (STS); Security; Smart borders","human; research ethics; Ethics, Research; Humans",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Åm, H., Limits of decentered governance in science-society policies (2019) Journal of Responsible Innovation, 6 (2), pp. 163-178; Bensaude Vincent, B., The politics of buzzwords at the interface of technoscience, market and society: The case of ‘public engagement in science’ (2014) Public Understanding of Science, 23 (3), pp. 238-253; Bigo, D., The (in)securitization practices of the three universes of EU border control: Military/navy–border guards/police–database analysts (2014) Security Dialogue, 45 (3), pp. 209-225; Bigo, D., Carrera, S., Hayes, B., Hernanz, N., Jeandesboz, J., (2012) Evaluating current and forthcoming proposals on JHA databases and a smart borders system at EU external borders, p. 462. , European Parliament.

Each member state and border practitioner exploits its own set of assets in their goal of border surveillance and control. States have invested significantly in these assets and infrastructures necessary to manage and control the transit in the border areas. As new capabilities and assets become available and as current Command and Control (C2) systems become older, border control practitioners are faced with the increasing challenge of how to integrate new assets, command and control all of them in a coordinated and coherent way without having to invest in a completely new C2 systems built from the ground up. Therefore, and bearing in mind that the systems already developed up to date are very old and are not framed in a global standard data model, it has been identified, on one side the need to define a platform that allows to interact with multiple UxVs (land, sea and air), and on the other, unify all data models so that it can globalize and generate a much more concise analysis of what happens in places of conflict. © 2021. by the authors.","Border Control; Distributed Infrastructure; Situational Awareness; UxVs",,,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 740736","This work has been performed under the H2020 740736 project CAMELOT, which has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Program.

The author follows the construction of the FTF as a serious security threat to the European Union’s strategies and action plans, and demonstrates the EU’s practical actions to respond the threat: criminalization of “suspicious travel”, strengthening border security, preliminary screening of asylum seekers at the border. The article pays special attention to the EU plans to achieve compatibility of the European Union information systems, while emphasizing new opportunities for the law enforcement bodies to access migration databases for combating terrorism. Exploring the new EU integration plan for migrants, the author notes that this is for the first time that the European Commission focuses its efforts not only on migrants, but also on the EU citizens with “migratory background”, which is undoubtedly dictated by a fear of the extremist ideology influence on young people. The article exposes certain similarities between the Commission’s methods to coordinate integration and inclusion of migrants, reintegration of the FTF and their families, which indicates that the migration policy is becoming a part of the EU security policy. That leads to a conclusion that securitization of migration policy aims not only and not so much at preventing the potential threat of the returnees’ terrorist activities, but at curbing migration flows as a whole and reducing the number of asylum seekers, in particular. Nevertheless, terrorism and migration seem to be closely linked in public discourse, despite the absence of an empirical basis to conclude that these factors directly influence each other. The author considers the most difficult problem of modern migration policy to be the definition of the red line beyond which its securitization can be justified. © 2021 Olga Yu.

The present article investigates a specific set of measures that involve the harnessing of “new technology” to enact systematic controls on persons traveling across the internal borders of Schengen states, through the processing of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data and in the framework of the EU PNR Directive. It argues that PNR data processing should at the same time be understood as part of the alternatives to border checks available for Member States to regulate cross-border mobility in the Schengen area and as a standout among these measures. PNR data processing challenges the existing legal framework of Article 23(a) of the Schengen Borders Code (SBC) as well as the assessment framework developed by the CJEU in its relevant case-law, not because it contravenes Schengen rules, but because it stretches and overflows them. Ultimately, PNR data processing puts into question the very understanding of what checks performed in relation to the act or intention of crossing a border actually stand for or whether controls related to border crossings can be characterised as border controls. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2021","Free movement; Internal borders; PNR; Schengen; Systematic checks",,,,,,,"The author would like to thank colleagues of the ULB's Centre de droit europ?en (CDE) for their invitation to present an earlier version of this text in their internal seminar and for insightful comments.

This article provides a legal analysis on the embedment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools at the EU level in information systems for TCNs and critically examines the fundamental rights concerns that ensue from the use AI to manage and control migration. It discusses automated risk assessment and algorithmic profiling used to examine applications for travel authorisations and Schengen visas, the shift towards the processing of facial images of TCNs and the creation of future-proof information systems that anticipate the use of facial recognition technology. The contribution understands information systems as enabling the datafication of mobility and as security tools in an era whereby a foreigner is risky by default. It is argued that a violation of the right to respect for private life is merely the gateway for a series of other fundamental rights which are impacted, such as nondiscrimination and right to effective remedies. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2021","Borders; Data protection; Discrimination; Fundamental rights; Information systems; Migration management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bonditti, P., From territorial spaces to networks: A foucauldian approach to the implementation of biometry (2004) Alternatives: Global, Local, Political, 29, p. 465; Besters, M., Brom, F., Greedy” information technology: The digitalization of the European migration policy (2010) European Journal of Migration and Law, 12 (4), p. 455; Hayes, B., (2009) NeoConOpticon: The EU Security-Industrial Complex, p. 35. , Transnational Institute/Statewatch; Molnar, P., Technology on the margins: AI and global migration management from a human rights perspective (2019) Cambridge International Law Journal, 8 (2), p. 305; Molnar, P., Gill, L., (2018) Bots at the Gate: A Human Rights Analysis of Automated Decision-Making in Canada's Immigration and Asylum System, , University of Toronto; (2020) Opportunities and Challenges for the Use of Artificial Intelligence in Border Control, Migration and Security, , Commission; Dumbrava, C., (2021) Artificial Intelligence at EU Borders - Overview of Applications and Key Issues, , European Parliament Research Service; Vavoula, N., The “puzzle” of EU large-scale information systems for third-country nationals: Surveillance of movement and its challenges for privacy and data protection' (2020) European Law Review, 45 (3), p. 348. , For an overview; (2000) Convention Implementing the Schengen Agreement (CISA) of 14 June 1985, pp. L239-L319. , O; Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006 (2006) OJ, pp. L381-L384; Council Decision 2007/533/JHA (2007) OJ, pp. L205-L263; Regulation (EU) 2018/1860 (2018) OJ, pp. L312-L321; Regulation (EU) 2018/1861 (2018) OJ, pp. L312-L314; Regulation (EU) 2018/1862 (2018) OJ, pp. L312-L356; Brouwer, E., (2008) Digital Borders and Real Rights: Effective Remedies for Third-Country Nationals in the Schengen Information System, , Martinus Nijhoff; Brouwer, E., Schengen's Undesirable Aliens (2019) Caught in Between Borders - Citizens, Migrants, Humans: Liber Amicorum in Honour of Prof. Dr. Elspeth Guild, , Paul Minderhoud, Sandra Mantu and Karin Zwaan eds, Wolf Legal Publishers; Council decision 2004/512/EC (2004) OJ, pp. L213-L215; Regulation (EC) 767/2008 (2009) OJ, pp. L243-L251. , VIS Regulation; Council Decision 2008/633/JHA (2008) OJ, pp. L218-L1129; Regulation (EU) 2021/1134 (2021) OJ, pp. L248-L311. , 2021 VIS Regulation; Regulation 603/2013 (2013) OJ, pp. L180-L191; Regulation (EU) 604/2013 (2013) OJ, pp. L180-L231; Regulation (EU) 2018/1240 (2018) OJ, pp. L236-L241. , ETIAS Regulation; Regulation (EU) 2019/816 (2019) OJ, pp. L135-L141; Regulation (EU) 2019/817 (2019) OJ, pp. L135-L227; Regulation (EU) 2019/818 (2019) OJ, pp. L135-L185; Regulation (EU) 2021/1152 (2021) OJ, pp. L249-L315. , addition to Article 20, as mentioned earlier; Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (2016) OJ, pp. L119-L121; Alegre, S., Jeandesboz, J., Vavoula, N., (2017) European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS): Border Management, Fundamental Rights and Data Protection, pp. 23-26. , Study for the LIBE Committee of the European Parliament; Regulation (EU) 2021/1151 (2021) OJ, pp. L249-L257; Leese, M., The new profiling: Algorithms, Black Boxes, and the Failure of Anti-discriminatory Safeguards in the European Union (2014) Security Dialogue, 45 (5), p. 494; Directive (EU) 2016/681 (2016) OJ, pp. L11-L132. , also the contribution by Julien Jeandesboz in this special; (2018) Guidelines on Automated Individual Decision-Making and Profiling for the Purposes of Regulation 2016/679, p. 8. , Article 29 Working Party WP251; Joined Cases C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18 La Quadrature du Net and Others v Premier Ministre and Others (2020) EU, p. 791. , C; (2017) Fundamental Rights and the Interoperability of EU Information Systems: Borders and Security, p. 30. , FRA; (2018) Under Watchful Eyes: Biometrics, EU IT Systems and Fundamental Rights, pp. 81-94. , FRA; (2016) Commission, pp. 9-10. , COM 655final, 12; (2019) EU Information Systems Supporting Border Control - A Strong Tool, but More Focus Needed on Timely and Complete Data, pp. 29-30. , European Court of Auditors; (2018) Inaccurate Data in Schengen System “Threatens Rights, , https://euobserver.com/tickers/140468, euobserver, 8 January accessed 10 August 2021.

It is shown that pushbacks have become a standardized frontline tool of border management. This phenomenon is approached from a criminological viewpoint in terms of racist state crime and as a racist biopolitical technology of power for the government of the migrant populations, and for the defence of society and national identity. Showing that pushbacks are a becoming a central border policy in Europe, the paper concludes with a discussion of the need for both legal and non-legal counter-strategies. © 2021 Pluto Journals.

Although border and critical security studies have increasingly focused on the multiple aspects of techno-materiality and infrastructural devices of border control, less has been said about how such an infrastructure encodes and transmits collective future visions of border (in)security. Therefore, this paper analyzes the making of a sociotechnical imaginary of digital transformation of the EU border regime, specifically focusing on the role of eu-LISA, the European agency for the development and management of large-scale IT systems. Drawing on ethnographic observations and interview material, we analyze the ways in which this agency emerges as a site for assembling and rehearsing this sociotechnical imaginary, gradually transforming borders into sites of experimentation in the EU Schengen laboratory. As our case illustrates, studying the visionary dimensions of digital infrastructuring helps us to understand how imagination becomes collectivized and materialized, opens up or closes down sociotechnical realizations, and thus tacitly governs the project of digitally infrastructuring the EU border regime. © The Author(s) 2021.","digitalization; experimental politics; governing migration; infrastructuring borders; sociotechnical imaginary",,,,,,"Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, ÖAW: 2018-2021; Universität Wien","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Research for this article was supported by the DOC Fellowship of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (2018-2021) at the Department of Science and Technology Studies, University of Vienna.

New cross-border regimes of biometrics and databasing in the EU are con-tributing to a conflation of the treatment of irregularity, asylum seeking, and criminality. States provide migrants’ biometric data to transnational databases that are increasingly interoperable in the area of migration and crime control, to be accessible for state-based law enforcement actors. This article uses the case of Eurodac – a biometric database initially developed for migration control purposes – to explore the ongoing expansion of law enforcement access to the collected information for the purpose of crime control. The article studies how borders are selectively made permeable for biometric data flows in the light of “crimmigration” discourses. It combines insights from critical migration, border, and security studies that address the increasing overlapping of migration and crime control in policy discourse, law, and surveillance technologies. The study addresses the reconfiguration of crimmi-gration – and the normalisation and diversification of the figure of the “crim-migrant other” – through the expansion of cross-border flows of biometric data by law enforcement. © 2021, GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences.

Some scholars have even assumed that nation states would eventually lose control of their borders due to new challenges. However, borders have proved to be resilient institutions as states have adapted and rein-vented border controls in several ways. First, states have responded to new challenges by hardening their territorial boundaries through border fortifica-tions. Second, governments have shifted border control to third countries by using tools such as visa policies or readmission agreements. Third, nation states have designed “smart borders” through biometric passports, shared databases, and digital surveillance technologies. Lastly, de-facto borders show that clearly delimited boundaries can be attractive to countries, even in regions with limited statehood. © 2021, GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences.

Recently there has been a considerable increase in the use of computational techniques to predict migration flows, and advances have allowed for application of improved algorithms in the field. However, given the rapid pace of technological development facilitating these new predictive tools and methods for migration, it is important to address the extent to which such instruments and techniques engage with and impact migration governance. This study provides an in‐depth examination of selected existing predictive tools in the migration field and their impact on the governance of migratory flows. It focuses on a comparative qualitative examination of these tools’ scope, as well as how these characteristics link to their respective underlying migration theory, research question, or objective. It overviews how several organisations have developed tools to predict short‐ or longer‐term migration patterns, or to assess and estimate migration uncertain-ties. At the same time, it demonstrates how and why these instruments continue to face limitations that in turn affect migration management, especially as it relates to increasing EU institutional and stakeholder efforts to forecast or predict mixed migration. The main predictive migration tools in use today cover different scopes and uses, and as such are equally valid in shaping the requirements for a future, fully comprehensive predictive migration tool. This article provides clarity on the requirements and features for such a tool and draws conclusions as to the risks and opportunities any such tool could present for the future of EU migration governance. © 2021 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","European union; Forecasting; Migration governance; Predictive tools",,,,,,"Open Society Foundations, OSF; International Business Machines Corporation, IBM; Udenrigsministeriet; Horizon 2020: 882986","The authors are grateful to Alexander Kjaerum, Kalev Leetaru, Constantinos Melachrinos, Rebeca Moreno Jimenez, Teddy Wilkin, and Sylvain Ponserre, for their key inputs as part of this study, and to Daniel Morente and Christopher Neeson for their relevant feedback on ear‐ lier drafts of this article.

This Article intends to shine a light from a legal perspective on the ambivalence of the means and ends of the ETIAS database. ETIAS is not solely an instrument of migratory flow management. It is also, more discretely, a criminal justice instrument. In addition to the administrative function of ETIAS, there is a law-enforcement capability: once data pertaining to candidates seeking travel authorization is collected, it becomes available to ends which are estranged from the administrative function of ETIAS. This Article intends to highlight the opaque nature of ETIAS resulting from its cumulating complexities at the crossroads of law and information technology, EU and member states competences, administrative and criminal laws. ETIAS is indicative of a more global model that it is helping to deploy, suggesting the prospect of a data set pertaining to migrants and available for criminal purposes. In conclusion, this Article raises the following questions: is ETIAS compatible with fundamental liberties? And in this respect should its hidden criminal dimension raise concerns? © 2021.

The structure of the listing is surprising: law enforcement operates through a penal procedure includes such investigations. It is therefore difficult to make a completely different purpose from this third term, unless perhaps the pleonasm is being used rhetorically; 62 An initial reference concerns the terrorist offences referred to in the Directive 2017/541/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2017 on combating terrorism and replacing Council Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA and amending Council Decision 2005/671/JHA.

According to art. 53(3) Regulation 2018/1240, the Europol requests for consultation of data ""shall be subject to prior verification by a specialised unit of duly empowered Europol officials""; 69 Ibid. art. 4(e) and art. 23(1), specify the SIS notifications/reports of which the applicant may be the subject, supported by the comparison with ETIAS data made by the ETIAS central system; , p. 17. , 70 Ibid. art; Only one datum gathered from the applicant is excluded from the consultation for penal purposes: the studies carried out by the interested party (see art. 52(4) in fine, referring to art. 17(2)(h) Regulation, , 71 Ibid. arts 50 ff. 2018/1240 cit); 72 The reasoning would be different if the offences for which the law enforcement authorities are authorised to consult ETIAS were related, at least, to migration in general. And yet, that is not the case. The offences in question are defined by a set of references to two instruments with no relationship to migration: on the one hand, the Directive 2017/541 cit. for terrorist offences; and on the other hand, the offences listed in Framework Decision 2002/584, for “other serious criminal offences”, art. 2(2) cit. Unrelated to border management, these instruments list offences that have no particular link with the migration issue -except, for instance, facilitation of unauthorised entry and residence. The reference made by the ETIAS regulation to these instruments is therefore not based on an analogy between their respective purposes; Stumpf, J, The Crimmigration Crises: Immigrants, Crime, and Sovereign Power (2006) AmULRev, p. 367. , 73 About “crimmigration in particular; 74 European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) Opinion on the amended proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the establishment of ‘Eurodac' for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of Regulation (EC) (establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national or a stateless person), and on the proposal for a Council Decision on requesting comparisons with Eurodac data by Member States' law enforcement authorities and Europol for law enforcement purposes of 7 October 2009, para. 47. The words are evocative, taken from a landmark judgement of the European Court of Human Rights ruling against the United Kingdom for being in breach of art. 8 of the Convention, , (ECtHR S and Marper the United Kingdom Ap 30562/04 an 30566/04 [4 December 2008] para. 122).

The adoption of two regulations is made necessary by the variablegeometry application, depending on the Member States, of the provisions of the Schengen acquis related to police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters; 83 The definition of the correspondence of data between ETIAS and other systems will therefore be crucial.

AI algorithms can perform several tasks including border controls, identity checks and predictive policing procedures. However, the utilization of such tools in the migration context raises several issues which must be analyzed and discussed in their implications. The presence of bias in datasets can lead to outcomes detrimental to the already vulnerable conditions of migrants. Furthermore, the inherent opaqueness of AI algorithms working routine does not allow the formulation of a clear accountability framework. This article aims to address these concerns to formulate valid answers from a legal and technological perspective, mainly focusing on the European Union approach to these issues. © 2020.

Frontex, the European border control agency, is carefully considering new ways to secure European borders and to improve its technological capabilities.34 It is following the development of several projects financed with research funds from the Horizon 2020 programme. Frontex recently signed an agreement with the Directorate-General for Migration and Home Affairs of the European Commission (DG-HOME) for the supervision and implementation of research projects related to border security issues.35 The TRESPASS project aims to implement a risk-based approach in the operations of controlling national borders and regulating the entry of foreigners into the national territory. Algorithms collect and process data to identify, according to certain indicators, the level of “risk” of each possible entry within the state borders.36 The ROBORDER project aims to implement a fully automated and unmanned border surveillance system. More specifically, it is a complex of mobile robotic vehicles capable of operating on any surface.37 The FOLDOUT project aims to create a platform for real-time surveillance of state borders. A set of sensors collects information to inform border guards about possible threats along the borders.38 The aim is to immediately detect any illegal cross-border movement. These are just a few examples of projects that have been considered. Frontex has also evaluated other solutions over the years: digital platforms for remote identification of vessels, biometric scanning and heartbeat recognition systems (to detect migrants hiding in vehicles and containers attempting to cross European borders illegally).39 Algorithmic system can also work for lie detection purposes. The idea is to use these tools to detect if people requesting visas or entry permit are lying about their credentials through the processing of biometric data like facial expressions.","The iBorderCtrl project funded by the European Commission is a clear example of how the use of algorithmic systems at European borders can have worrying results and create dystopian situations. The AI-driven lie-detection system was responsible for checking the reliability and truthfulness of travellers’ statements at border controls to enter European territory. However, the functioning of this mechanism was obscure and not understandable to human observers. There was also a risk that it would take into account variables such as the ethnic origin or nationality of respondents in a discriminatory manner. The iBorderCtrl case illustrates how algorithmic technologies are not inherently neutral, but they act accordingly to purposes determined by actors and stakeholders. As far as fields of public importance like migration management are concerned, elected politicians and lawmakers formulate such purposes. The migration crisis of 2015 and the gradual rise to political power of parties that see immigration as a possible threat has influenced European action. The EU is currently funding the implementation surveillance tools and training programmes for border police in neighbouring countries.102 The aim is to prevent migratory flows currently in circulation from reaching EU territory. This attempt to “outsource” the surveillance of European borders and the management of migratory phenomena to other States raises several concerns. All the more so considering the impact that algorithmic tools can have in such a situation, as explained in this paper. Several EU bodies and agencies are funding these activities for different goals and acting on different legal grounds. The lack of a clear framework of intervention for these programmes is an issue in terms of fundamental rights safeguards. The EU’s increasing focus on the technological control of its borders has led to an increase in the budget for Frontex.103 Similarly, surveillance systems industries are constantly lobbying Frontex officers to influence their actions and therefore increasing their profit opportunities.104 Thus, private economic interests and political pressures can be determining factors in influencing EU action in managing migration phenomena. The EU Member States must cooperate to develop an integrated and collaborative border management policy (Art.77.2 TFEU).105 The principles of solidarity and fair sharing of responsibilities must characterize the European Union’s action in the context of migration and management of its borders (Art.80 TFEU), including the deployment of technological means at the European frontiers. The European Parliament recently did not approve the financial budget of Frontex over concerns about the lack of respect for fundamental rights in the management of migratory flows.106",,,,,,,,,,"Forti, M.; Sant’Anna School of Advanced StudiesItaly; email: mirko.forti@santannapisa.it",,,"University of Trento",,,,,22844503,,,,"English; Spanish","BioLaw J.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108519786

They have been extended beyond territorial borders, immigration policies and assigned legal identities and downshifted to ‘inside’ spaces across state and non-state ‘ordinary institutions’. This article claims for EU migrants in pre-Brexit UK, immigration controls have worked through a process of ‘bureaucratic bordering’ that infiltrates the post-arrival regularisation of statuses and affects broader pathways of incorporation. The discussion draws on episodes of participant observation with Bulgarian arrivals to trace the tightening of administrative procedures that ensued in the aftermath of labour market liberalisation in 2014. These are explored for their productive, rather than restrictive potential, namely, for implicating migrants in a bureaucratically induced temporality of ‘protracted arrival’ in the process of which they are stripped off of their formal rights and made dependent on subordinated forms of employment and existence within the confines of the ‘migrant economy’. By exploring the politics and experiences of intra-EU migration through analytical concepts devised for ‘precarious’ movements, such as ‘bordering’, ‘differential inclusion’, and ‘permanent temporariness’, this article questions the incisive conceptual and empirical binaries between internal and external migrations and joins the voices of those warning to the eroding protection of EU citizenship. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bordering; Bulgarian; informal economy; Intra-EU migration; temporality",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ahmad, A., The Labour Market Consequences of Human Smuggling: 'Illegal' Employment in London's Migrant Economy (2008) Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, 34 (6), pp. 853-874; Alberti, G., (2017), The Government of Migration through Workfare the UK.

It introduces the concept of borderwork ‘creep’, to highlight how border management practices have, in the last 15 years, expanded along three axes. This term borrows from debates on ‘function creep’ in surveillance studies which have generally been focused on digital technologies in the global north. The first axis is a cartographic one, with borderwork functioning through a denial of cartographic limits to border security. Borderwork has crept inland, with security practices taking an expansive vision of the borderland and bringing controls to key inland nodes. The second is that of a cross-pollination of policy areas with a growing role for judicialised modes of justification for borderwork. The third relates to faith in technology, with new digital geographies making borderwork in the Sahel reliant on data handling and sharing. To make these arguments, the article draws on fieldwork since 2013 in Senegal, Mauritania, and Niger. By examining the breadth and expansion of borderwork in the Sahel, it contests visions that centre ‘Fortress Europe’ and instead highlights the multiple often overlapping global and local interests that expand borderwork in the Sahel. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Amoore, L., Biometric borders: Governing mobilities in the war on terror (2006) Political Geography, 25 (3), pp. 336-351; Baker, T., Cook, I.R., McCann, E., Temenos, C., Ward, K., Policies on the move: The transatlantic travels of tax increment financing (2016) Annals of the American Association of Geographers, 106 (2), p. 459; Balibar, É., (2002) Politics and the other scene, , Trans.

Outside of Europe, however, the paucity of resources and vastness of spaces mean that indigenous forms of agency continue to be a key factor of border governance. Focusing on everyday practices illuminated by ethnographic fieldwork, this article investigates EU border externalisation’s encounter with the Sahelian context. It argues that state and non-state actors form, deform and perform borders by extracting and capturing the material (economic) and immaterial (cognitive) resources that pass through liminal spaces. These dynamics shape a biopolitical economy of border control in which features of exceptionality, sovereignty and politics seem less compelling that those pertaining to the sphere of ordinary, hybridity and economy. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abrahamsen, R., Africa and international relations: Assembling Africa, studying the world (2016) African Affairs, 116-462, pp. 125-139; Adler-Nissen, R., Towards a practice turn in EU studies: The everyday of European integration (2016) Journal of Common Market Studies, 54 (1), pp. 87-103; Agamben, G., (1998) Homo sacer: Sovereign power and bare life, , Redwood City (CA): Stanford University Press; Akkerman, M., (2018) Expanding the Fortress.

While much discussion of border struggles focuses on migrants’ resistance and various forms of activism, this paper provides insights on the micro-resistance of those who, instead of overtly opposing and contesting the biopolitical power of border regimes, are integral to their operation: asylum caseworkers who filter and select border-crossers. The paper presents data from interviews with self-identified leftist asylum caseworkers in Greece who, through their work, seek to create cracks in the so-called ‘Fortress Europe’. By exploring the somewhat unexplored occupational culture of leftist asylum caseworkers, we show how, while trying to resist bordering regimes, leftist asylum caseworkers both critique and reproduce the power relations they seek to subvert. Essentially, we provide valuable insights on the limits of resistance due to the workings of powerful technologies of government–informed by neoliberal managerialism–that are operational in day-to-day life of the asylum process. The paper thus provides a novel exploration of the complex and entangled relation between technologies of power and micro-resistances within border regimes in the significant context of Greece. © 2021 The Author(s).

Illustrated through an encounter between a migrant and the Visa Information System (VIS)–one of the largest migration-related biometric databases worldwide–the article’s first part outlines three implications of digitisation. We argue that the VIS assembles a set of previously unconnected state authorities into a group of end users who enact border security and migration management through the gathering, processing and sharing of data; facilitates the practice of traceability, understood as a rationality of mobility control; and has restrictive effects on migrants’ capacity to manoeuvre and resist control. Given these implications, the article’s second part introduces three analytical sensitivities that help to avoid some analytical traps when studying digitisation processes. These sensitivities take their cue from insights and concepts in science and technology studies (STS), specifically material semiotics/ANT approaches. They concern, firstly, the ways that data-based security practices perform the identities of the individuals that they target; secondly, the need to consider possible practices of subversion by migrants to avoid control-biased analyses; and finally, the challenge to study the design and development of border security technologies without falling into either technological or socio-political determinism. © 2020 The Author(s).

Scholars have, however, tended to apprehend dispersal in its geographical dimension, failing to interrogate bordering beyond spatial distancing from the territorial edges of the state. Furthermore, dispersal strategies in non-European countries are underexplored. We start filling these gaps by examining how dispersal operates in Morocco–a country where, since the announcement of a new migration policy in 2013, the routine internal dispersal of groups of dark-skinned people racially profiled as ‘illegal sub-Saharan’ by Moroccan police forces has become commonplace. Drawing on extensive qualitative fieldwork conducted between 2016 and 2019, as well press articles and NGO reports, we advance a dynamic understanding of bordering by analysing how the repeated spatial relocation of migrant people works through and in tandem with mechanisms of dispossession. We draw together literature on dispersal as migration governance and on dispossession as containment, proposing that dispersal activates practices of dispossession that expand the reach of bordering beyond spatial distance, turning it into an embodied technology: migrant people profiled as ‘sub-Saharan’ experience bordering as a form of inflicted hypermobility and a condition of protracted, unbearable living to which they are confined. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bordering; dispersal; dispossession; immigration; Morocco","dispersal; governance approach; immigrant population; immigration; immigration policy; migration; mobility; Morocco",,,,,"Society for Libyan Studies, SLS; Gates Cambridge Trust","Lorena Gazzotti thanks the Centre Jacques Berque in Rabat and the Society for Lybian Studies for funding field research in the summer 2019.

While the policing of mobilities is increasingly discussed in terms of instantaneity, speed, and real-timeness, little has been said about the temporalities of data mobility. This paper focuses on the socio-technical architectures that are generative of data mobilities and analyses the temporality of data circulation as the outcome of a contingent formation of various actors, sites, and materials. Based on an indepth analysis of the Frontex information system Joint Operation Reporting Application (JORA), it works out several sources of turbulence that turn data mobility into a ‘crooked’ process of patching multiple temporalities and paces together. It will show how the implementation of JORA faces data frictions, issues of data quality, the synchronization of multiple orderings, and the clash of temporalities of border control practices on the ground. Thus, the infrastructuring of data circulation has effects on interorganizational forms of collaboration and knowledge production as well as on border work in the field of European migration and border control. © 2020 The Author(s).

Beyond observing the incongruous character of the integration discourse, the article unpacks the ways in which this framing fulfils a specific function within the broader setup of migration control and the gendered modalities of migrant governance on a daily basis. The article argues that life in the CETI presents the fundamental characteristics of an existence inscribed within a total institution, implying the use of discipline as a technology of power and a structure of relations based on deference, in the specific guise of residents’ condition as ‘subjects to be integrated’. Furthermore, the article identifies three forms of dispossession–material, role and time-related–carried out against the background of a fictional integration, each bringing its share of gendered implications. This article draws on fieldwork conducted in Melilla over three months, with regular visits to the CETI that entailed participant observation inside the Centre as well as semi-structured interviews with migrant women on the one hand, and social, healthcare, and administrative workers on the other. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Since the biggest group of people who are age-estimated in Denmark are Afghans, the author looks at the relationship between Denmark and Afghanistan and draws on interviews with people who underwent the process. By connecting medical documents with biometric measurement in colonial contexts and the current expansion of biometric surveillance, the author argues that the collection of intrusive physical data from Afghan minors is to be understood as a colonial mapping of the body. The Danish Immigration Service’s age decision-making process articulates a form of administrative rule that works to depoliticise questions of dispossession and death, and is a form of colonial violence enabled by humanitarian discourse and law. © 2020 Institute of Race Relations.","Afghanistan; biometric surveillance; Danish Immigration Service; Denmark; Eurodac; imperialist technology; medical age assessments; unaccompanied minors; ‘war on terror’","Afghan; Afghanistan; article; asylum seeker; biometry; decision making; Denmark; human; immigration; interview; medical assessment; violence",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arce, J., Suárez-Krabbe, J., Racism, global apartheid and disobedient mobilities: the politics of detention and deportation in Europe and Denmark (2018) KULT: postkolonial temaserie, 15, p. 21. , ‘, ’, p; Sudbury, J., A world without prisons: resisting militarism, globalized punishment, and empire (2004) Social Justice, 31 (1-2), p. 10. , ‘, ’, p; Gordon, A.F., Abu Ghraib: imprisonment and the war on terror (2006) Race & Class, 48 (1), p. 54. , July, ‘, ’, p; Gilmore, R.W., (2007) Golden Gulag: prisons, surplus, crisis, and opposition in globalizing California, p. 37. , http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/kbdk/detail.action?docID=1873254, Berkerley, CA, University of California Press, (, :,), p; A world without prisons: resisting militarism, globalized punishment, and empire, p. 11. , ‘, ’, p; (2018) Press Release: EU Budget - Commission Proposes Major Funding Increase for Stronger Borders and Migration, , http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-4106_en.htm, June, ‘, ’; UUI Alm.Del Endeligt Svar På Spørgsmål 322, , ‘, ’ (Udlændinge- og Integrationsministeriet, January 2017).

In Europe, the establishment of the Schengen Area necessitated the screening of movements and travel of citizens from third countries across Schengen Area’s external border. The main drawback of adopting new technology especially at border points is associated with price and training of personnel. Existing smart border technologies are built on the concepts of Entry and Exit systems and the Registered Travellers Programme. The Mediterranean region was the first to adopt these smart border technological systems.

At the European Union (EU) level, the Cybersecurity Act establishes a common cybersecurity certification framework supporting the coexistence of different certification schemes across Member States. However, its realization needs to be sustained by technical approaches to enable ICT stakeholders from different sectors or countries to exchange cybersecurity information and evaluate the up-to-date security level of an ICT system throughout their lifecycle. Toward this end, we propose a blockchain-based platform using a novel interledger design, where ledgers associated with ICT artifacts, cybersecurity certificates, and vulnerabilities are interconnected. The main purpose is to leverage the advantages of blockchain in terms of distributed trust, transparency, and accountability, while at the same time coping with scalability, performance, and interoperability requirements. We analyze the impact of our platform in the current EU legislation and provide insights for its deployment. © 1997-2012 IEEE.","Blockchain; Cybersecurity Certification; Interledger","Life cycle; Cross-border; Cyber security; EU legislation; ICT systems; Information and Communication Technologies; Interoperability requirements; Security level; Blockchain",,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 779984",,,,,,,,,,,"Voas, J., Laplante, P.A., IoT's certification quagmire (2018) Computer, 51 (4), pp. 86-89; Palattella, M.R., Internet of things in the 5G era: Enablers, architecture, and business models (2016) IEEE J.

Drawing on a study of the creation of a new border detection device, and ideas from Science and Technology Studies, we argue that devices deployed as objective tools for risk assessment and management in the policing of borders, and the laboratories that develop them, are not simply linear applications of scientific knowledge to control risk but rather are crucial sites in which multiple and contending conceptions and practices of risk converge. Following the interactions of scientists, border guards, policing agents and the EU shows how an official discourse of risk, a scientific conception and experiential working knowledge of risk all ‘danced’ together in the development of a portable detection device. In the process experiential/contextual and professional knowledge of risk were often privileged over rationalistic and statistically based risk assessment. © The Author(s) 2018.","Border; CBRNE; policing; risk; security; technology",,,,,,"Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Dstl; Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/K011332/1","The authors are grateful to Robert Miller, Sarah Moore and the anonymous reviewers for comments on a previous draft, and to all those that kindly agreed to be interviewed and collaborated with the research process.

On one side, we highlight the industrial “political work” realised by these firms. Such activities consist in a contextual framing and a representation of an “artificial” industry sector (the security industry), to establish themselves as legitimate experts in the eyes of the governmental actors. On the other side, we study the institutional political work achieved by the European Commission, which uses this “savoir-faire” from the private sector to pursue its own supranational entrepreneurship strategies while sharing a common vision of borders control with the help of technologies. In doing so, the Commission has reconfigured to its benefits the JHA institutional dynamics, at the expense of others, as the European Parliament.

Tracing the biopolitical problematisation of the border that led to ETIAS, I argue that the system embodies a shift towards data behaviourism in the regime of truth underlying the biopolitical regulation of the EU border. Data behaviourism establishes a new way of seeing conduct, adding a potential future layer to it. Taming future mobilities through data-mining and future-oriented algorithmic processing, ETIAS imagines mobile subjects in terms of their motility and thereby produces dividuals and blurs the spatio-temporal boundedness of the EU border. ETIAS thereby complicates resistance by avoiding fixed identities and instead rarefies subjects through seeing them as being constantly emergent through new correlations. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","biopolitics; border security; Circulation; data behaviourism; dividuals; technology","authoritarianism; correlation; European Union; international relations; political border; regional security; travel behavior; Europe",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adey, P., Facing Airport Security: Affect, Biopolitics, and the Preemptive Securitisation of the Mobile Body (2009) Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 27 (2), pp. 274-295; Alegre, S., Jeandesboz, J., Vavoula, N., (2017) European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS): Border Management, Fundamental Rights and Data Protection, , https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2017/583148/IPOL_STU(2017)583148_EN.pdf , Accessed November 17, 2019; Amoore, L., Data Derivatives.

Alterity processing refers to the data infrastructures, knowledge practices, and bureaucratic procedures through which populations unknown to European actors are translated into “European-legible” identities. By drawing on fieldwork conducted in Italy and the Hellenic Republic from 2017 to 2018, this article argues that different registration and identification procedures compete to legitimize different chains of actors, data, and metadata as more authoritative than others. Competing procedures have governance implications, as well, with some actors being included and others being excluded. Furthermore, there is evidence that—despite procedural rigidities—applicants themselves propose alternative chains of actors, data, and metadata that are more meaningful to them. In this tension, it is not only the individual Other that is enacted but also specific bureaucratic orders cutting across old and new European actors and distinctive understandings of “Europe.” From a technology studies perspective, this article engages in a dialogue with the emergent debate on Hotspots, the scholarship about the infrastructural construction of Europe and political sociology. © The Author(s) 2019.","bureaucracy; data infrastructures; Europe; metadata; migration; population",,,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 714463; European Research Council, ERC","A first elaboration of this article?s framework was drafted while the author was a fellow at the Paris Institute for Advanced Studies.

The findings of this research suggest that by securitizing its migration policies through new surveillance technologies, the EU may risk violating its founding norms and principles.

This is fol-lowed by an analysis of the legal challenges arising from the establishment of so-called smart borders, i.e. borders involving automated border control and the interoperability of all large-scale information systems. The article poses two fundamental research questions. Firstly: how do these new phenomena affect the effectiveness of management of the external borders in the EU? Secondly: are the existing legal frameworks able to bear the changes that are occurring? It seems that the aspiration towards interoperability may cause ten-sions underlying the establishment and functioning of the area of freedom, security, and justice (AFSA) in the EU – if the EU’s information systems become more and more interoperable, then the EU legal order may become less and less consistent with them. © 2020 Author.","European Union; Integrated management of external borders; Interoperability; Large-scale information systems; New technologies; Smart borders",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bellanova, R., González-Fuster, G., Politics of Disappearance: Scanners and (Unobserved) Bodies as Mediators of Security Practices (2013) International Political Sociology, 7 (2); Beuving, M.A., Frontex.

The EU's databases in the Area of Freedom Security and Justice (AFSJ) for policing and migration purposes will be interconnected. This constitutes a paradigm shift for purpose limitation as a core element of data protection. This article identifies regulatory patterns and shortcomings in the technical and legal data protection arrangements of the interoperability regulations. The legal framework for data protection in the EU has developed considerably with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2016/679 and with Directive 2016/680 for policing and criminal justice. The European Data Protection Board, a multilevel accountability forum in which European and national data protection authorities cooperate has been established.

After a concise outline of the complex landscape within which these databases have been set up, emphasis is placed on the novelties and challenges that interoperability brings forward. In that regard, the articles evaluates the setting up of new databases, particularly the Biometric Matching Service and the Common Identity Repository – viewed through the Panopticon lens – the maximization of uses for which personal data may be destined, the revised rules on consultation of databases for law enforcement purposes, the challenge of ensuring data quality and the exercise of individual rights. If the EU uses its law enforcement and border control tools to the full, exploits the potential of inter-operability between information sources to identify any security concerns from a common pool of information, and uses the stage of entry into the EU as a key point for security checks to take place, the result will negate the ability of terrorist networks to exploit gaps.

For law enforcement purposes, there is also Regulation (EU) 2018/1862 (SIS II Regulations); 20 The fingerprint process is revised. Both the VIS and the Eurodac will store the fingerprints of third-country nationals over the age of six, whereas under the current rules the fingerprints are collected from individuals over the age of 12 (VIS) and 14 (Eurodac). Furthermore, as regards Eurodac, more categories of alphanumeric personal data will be collected. See Arts 10–12 of the recast Eurodac Proposal; According to Art. 17 of the recast Eurodac Proposal, the database will store the records on persons found irregularly crossing the external border of the EU for five years as opposed to eighteen months. The SIS II increased the retention period of alerts from three to five years, , 21; 22 For example, both Eurodac and the SIS II store records on irregular migrants. The EES will monitor the movement of third-country nationals covered by the VIS and the ETIAS. Convicted individuals' data will be stored in both the SIS II and the ECRIS-TCN; Databases could thus be conceived as the pieces of a puzzle.

They are the most advanced form of information exchange, conferring direct information access to competent authorities. Interoperable information systems are intended for the exchange of raw material for investigation purposes, which at a later stage could become evidence at trial. Interoperable information systems challenge existing cooperation dynamics and redefine the role of the actors involved. It is questionable whether mutual recognition and approximation, which have been considered the cornerstone of judicial cooperation in both civil and criminal matters for many years, can describe alone integration dynamics in law enforcement cooperation, particularly with reference to information sharing. This article appraises whether, and to what extent, law enforcement access to and use of interoperable information systems constitute new modes of law enforcement cooperation in the EU AFSJ. It then assesses what would be the implications of such a paradigm shift on information management. After a short overview of the main features of interoperability, it addresses whether and how the establishment and functioning of interoperable information systems actually or potentially redefines the existing distribution of tasks between th EU and Member States and among competent authorities of different kinds. © 2020 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands","approximation; Area of Freedom Security and Justice; European Union; information management; interoperability; law enforcement; mutual recognition; platform integration; principle of availability",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Boehm, Franziska, (2012) Information Sharing and Data Protection in the Area of Freedom Security and Justice, , 1 (Springer); Ballaschk, Julia, (2015) Interoperability of Intelligence Networks in the European Union, , 2 Ballaschk describes the interoperability between three different kinds of network: vertical networks, which are structured networks established by a formal legal arrangement (e.g. EU agencies such as Europol); horizontal networks, which are characterized by a certain degree of informality (e.g. Prüm cooperation); and intermediate networks, which are either established by a formal legal arrangement but hav hierarchical structure or have a hierarchical structure but no formal legal basis (e.g. SIS, VIS, Eurodac).

(Nomos); 63 More broadly, in law enforcement cooperation the principle of purpose limitation guarantees that the issuing law enforcement authority does not use the information obtained for other purposes.

At the same time, the way in which the ongoing interoperability initiatives regarding the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ) databases may influence Europol’s international cooperation raises arguably a set of new legal and practical questions that require urgent consideration. This article examines these issues by connecting the Europol-specific legal framework and international practice to the recently adopted AFSJ interoperability regulations as well as to the EU broader data protection framework. It looks more specifically at the balance between data protection/fundamental rights and operational effectiveness throughout Europol’s legal framework and practice of international cooperation and examines the implications of interoperability of AFSJ databases on this. On the one hand, interoperability of AFSJ databases is likely to boost Europol as an information hub through extended personal data collection and data processing possibilities, thereby making the Agency more attractive to international partners. On the other hand, the possibility to transfer such data outside the EU requires strong and effective safeguards from a data protection perspective. The article tentatively concludes that Europol’s current legal and practical framework for international cooperation seems to tilt the balance on the side of operational effectiveness to the detriment of data protection and fundamental rights, and that the new possibilities offered by the interoperability of AFSJ databases will further enhance this trend. © 2020 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands","AFSJ databases; data protection; effective police cooperation; Europol; fundamental rights; international cooperation; interoperability",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2017) Maximillian Schrems v.

Before First World War, Slovenia had been a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After the war in 1918, State of Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs were established and later in the same year also Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, which was renamed to Yugoslavia in 1929. In 1945, after Second World War, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has been established, where the Socialist Republic of Slovenia and the other five republics have been equal. Finally, in 1991 after a short 10-day war, an independent Republic Slovenia was established.

The entry ban entails that a non-citizen expelled from one member state is barred from returning to the whole Schengen area for up to five years, or longer in case of a threat to public policy or national security. The pan-European validity of the entry ban is ensured by an alert entered in the Schengen Information System (SIS). The alert is a set of personal data registered in the SIS which states may process to identify the person with a view of the refusal of entry. Processing personal data of non-citizens may pose a challenge to the protection of their data. The article assesses data protection rules laid down in the SIS Regulation (Regulation 1987/2006) and the Regulation which will replace it (Regulation 2018/1861). As it argues, SIS-specific data protection safeguards are frequently narrower than rules under data protection law, including the General Data Protection Regulation and Council of Europe Convention 108, and fall short of requirements flowing from the right to privacy under the European Convention of Human Rights and EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Data protection; entry ban; Returns Directive; right to privacy; Schengen Information System (SIS)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Baldaccini, A., The Return and Removal of Irregular Migrants Under EU Law: An Analysis of the Returns Directive (2009) EJML, 11 (1), pp. 1-17; Besters, M., Brom, F., 'Greedy’ Information Technology: The Digitalization of the European Migration Policy (2010) EJML, 12 (4), pp. 455-470; Broeders, D., Tracing, Identifying and Sorting: The Role of EU Migration Databases in the Internal Control on Irregular Migrants (2009) Migration and Mobility in Europe: Trends, Patterns and Control, pp. 249-271. , Fassmann H., Haller M., Lane D., (eds), Cheltenham: Elgar,. edited by; Brouwer, E., Data Surveillance and Border Control in the EU: Balancing Efficiency and Legal Protection (2006) Security Versus Freedom ?: A Challenge for Europe’s Future, pp. 137-154. , Balzacq T., Carrera S., (eds), Aldershot: Ashgate,. edited by; Brouwer, E., (2008) Digital Borders and Real Rights: Effective Remedies for Third-Country Nationals in the Schengen Information System, , Leiden: Nijhoff; Brouwer, E., Legal Boundaries and the Use of Migration Technology (2011) Migration and the New Technological Borders of Europe, pp. 134-169. , Dijstelbloem H., Meijer A., (eds), Basingstoke: Palgrave,. edited by; Brouwer, E., Interoperability of Databases and Interstate Trust: a Perilous Combination for Fundamental Rights (2019) Verfassungsblog, , https://verfassungsblog.de/interoperability-of-databases-and-interstate-trust-a-perilous-combination-for-fundamental-rights/; (2009) College van burgemeester en wethouders van Rotterdam v.

Turkey’s south-eastern border with Syria has been continuously upgraded with walls and fences incorporating advanced security technology. The border with Greece has witnessed a similar bordering process particularly under pressure from the European Union. Drawing on critical border studies and adopting a Foucauldian lens, this article explores these bordering processes, taking security technology as a heterogonous ensemble of practices that consists of discourses, regulations, institutions, threat perceptions, scientific knowledge etc. Finally, the article comes to two important conclusions. First, it suggests that the detection, filtering and prevention of ‘illegal’ border crossings, smuggling and terrorism are the key reasons advanced for the adoption of technologically intensive border control practices. On the other hand, a more ‘humanitarian discourse’, namely ‘saving the lives of migrants’ is also at play. Second, these security technologies are now increasingly embodied in practices of ‘inclusion’/‘exclusion’ that distinguish ‘risky’ (i.e. illegitimate) from ‘safe’ (i.e. legitimate) mobilities and that create spaces where inequality and injustice are experienced. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","biopolitics; Bordering processes; critical border studies; technology; Turkey",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2014) Struggling to Survive: Refugees from Syria in Turkey, , London: Amnesty International Ltd; (2015) Europe's Gatekeeper: Unlawful Detention and Deportation of Refugees from Turkey, , London: Amnesty International Ltd; Alkousaa, R., Popp, M., (2016), Refugees Crisis: The Death Strip at the Turkish-Syrian Border.

This article describes the multiplicity and diversity of these instruments. To analyse them more clearly, it distinguishes three types: legal, organisational and technological. The article equally points to the increasing relevance of technological tools, especially the use of biometrics. It also looks at how a founding member of the EU, France, and an associated country, Switzerland, utilise these European instruments to deport foreigners by focusing on the Dublin III Regulation as well as the Eurodac database, jointly referred to as the Dublin System. Grounding on a comparative study combining documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews and participant observation, this article describes the similarities and differences in the use of the Dublin System in these two countries. Moreover, it also reveals these countries’ specificities with regard to the roles played by local and national administrative bodies, and associative actors. The paper ends by concluding that to fully understand the deportation process in the European context as well as in certain countries, a multifaceted approach is required to make sense of the various interactions taking place between local, national and supranational frameworks, actors and practices. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","biometrics; Deportation; Dublin Regulation; Eurodac; European Union; France; Switzerland",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aas, K.F., The Body Does Not Lie’: Identity, Risk and Trust in Technoculture (2006) Crime, Media, Culture, 2 (2), pp. 143-158; Bigo, D., Guild, E., Policing at a Distance: Schengen Visa Policies (2005) Controlling Frontiers, pp. 233-274. , Bigo D., Guild E., (eds), Hants et Burlington: Ashgate, and,. edited by; Boswell, C., Geddes, A., (2011) Migration and Mobility in the European Union, , New York: Palgrave Macmillan; Broeders, D., The New Digital Borders of Europe: EU Databases and the Surveillance of Irregular Migrants (2007) International Sociology, 22 (1), pp. 71-92; Broeders, D., A European ‘Border’ Surveillance System Under Construction (2011) Migration and the New Technological Borders in Europe, pp. 40-67. , Dijstelbloem H., Meijer A., (eds), Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan,. edited by; Clarke, R., Human Identification in Information Systems (1994) Information Technology & People, 7 (4), pp. 6-37; (2018) Les conséquences économiques et financières de l’association de la Suisse à Schengen, , https://www.parlament.ch/centers/eparl/curia/2015/20153896/Bericht%20BR%20F.pdf, Bern: Rapport du Conseil fédéral en exécution du postulat 15.3896 du groupe socialiste.

EU laws and Schengen regulations support states’ implementation of high-tech methods in migration governance and police work. Our fieldwork, conducted with several police units in France and Romania, indicates a gap between the claimed ‘controlled’ management of mobility through crimmigration and the actual messiness at the Schengen border as a result of policy implementation limitations (lack of legislative adjustment to digital demands), poor administration (training of border agents, allocating resources) and political decisions (harmonisation or competing narratives). Despite the promotion of cutting-edge technologies in the deportation process, traditional techniques as well as paperwork remain relevant. This raises questions regarding the articulations of traditional techniques with highly promoted control technologies. While the latter has modified the functioning of the deportation process, these changes do not necessarily make the former useless. In practice, this work is left to the discretion of police officers and ground-level bureaucrats who interpret, create and enforce norms and regulations in the name of ‘the rule of law’. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","borders; citizenship; Digital technologies; migration; Schengen",,,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 713548; University of Warwick; European Research Council, ERC: 336319","This research was supported by the European Research Council, Starting Grant 336319; and by a WIRL-COFUND Fellowship jointly funded by the Institute of AdvancedStudy at the University of Warwick and the European Union?s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, under the Marie Sklodowska Curie COFUND action (grant agreement number 713548).

In recent years, scholars in social sciences and humanities have shown the continuities of colonialism and racism in the politics of biometric identification. Not only are the origins of biometrics closely related to colonial governance and scientific racism, but contemporary biometric technologies also continue to carry on colonial and racial dimensions in their infrastructures and operations. Inspired by Quijano’s notion of ‘coloniality of power’ and departing from existing social and cultural studies of biometrics, the article explores how biometrics is used for the racial classification of people, the (re)production of colonial structures and subject-object relations during and after colonialism. The article focuses on the case of fingerprinting border controls and surveillance in post-imperial Japan. This particular case geographically expands the literature on the relationship between biometrics and colonialism, which has been largely centred upon European and North American contexts. It also helps to understand how one mode of racialization through biometrics is replaced by another, which empowers a new form of racial governance. Drawing on my analysis of the postwar Japanese fingerprinting system, I suggest that it is important to register different forms of racialization through biometrics as there are different forms of racialized control in different historical and geographical contexts. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Biometrics; borders; colonialism; coloniality; Japan; racialization",,,,,,"University of Warwick; Suomen Akatemia: 307348, 321755","The preliminary research was funded by an East Asia Postgraduate Fellowship from the Department of Politics and International Studies at the University of Warwick.

In this techno-political moat, the communication networks of ‘Fortress Europe’ have established, through monitoring and interception technologies (and their corresponding speech acts), a buffer zone surrounding European Union (EU) territorial waters. In this buffer zone, the EU and its member states impose on refugees and migrants a survival test that stops all but the fittest from entering–a test that often results in serious and irreversible human rights violations. This paper examines the Mediterranean as a transidiomatic environment: a multilingual space shaped by the communicative practices of groups of people, either territorially defined or deterritorialized, who interact using an array of both face-to-face and long-distance media. These interactions are activated by two sets of opposing players: those involved in border reinforcement and those engaged in border crossing. Transidiomatic practices, in the form of either order-words or passwords, provide an effective angle for the analysis of the intense conflicts and struggles that today fill the Mediterranean borderscape. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","communication; Mediterranean; migration; power; Transidioma",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agamben, G., (2005) State of Exception, , Chicago: Chicago University Press; Althusser, L., (1971) Lenin and Philosophy and Other Essays., , New York: Monthly Review Press; Ben-Ghiat, R., Holm, S., (2015) Italian Mobilities, , London: Routledge, and, eds; Blommaert, J., Language, Asylum, and the National Order (2010) Current Anthropology, 50 (4), pp. 415-441; Blommaert, J., Rampton, B., Language and Superdiversity (2011) Diversities, 13 (2), pp. 1-21; Bondi, G., Ben Chouikha, I., (2011), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=him1yL5YTcw, Harraguantanamo; Brosch, C., On the Conceptual History of the Term Lingua Franca (2015) Apples - Journal of Applied Language Studies, 9 (1), pp. 71-85; Cifoletti, G., (1989) La Lingua Franca Mediterranea, , Padua, Italy: Unipress; Cohn, B., (1996) Colonialism and Its Forms of Knowledge, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Cristofaro, S., Putzu, I., (2000) Languages in the Mediterranean Area: Typology and Convergence, , Milano: FrancoAngeli; Crystal, D., (2000) Global English, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; De Bruijn, M., Nyamnjoh, F., Brinkman, I., (2009) Mobile Phones: The New Talking Drums of Everyday Africa, , Leiden: Langaa and African Studies Center, and, eds; De Fina, A., What is Your Dream?

From Big Data predictions about population movements in the Mediterranean, to Canada’s use of automated decision-making in immigration and refugee applications, to artificialintelligence lie detectors deployed at European borders, States are keen to explore the use of new technologies, yet often fail to take into account profound human rights ramifications and real impacts on human lives. These technologies are largely unregulated, developed and deployed in opaque spaces with little oversight and accountability. This paper examines how technologies used in the management of migration impinge on human rights with little international regulation, arguing that this lack of regulation is deliberate, as States single out the migrant population as a viable testing ground for new technologies. Making migrants more trackable and intelligible justifies the use of more technology and data collection under the guise of national security, or even under tropes of humanitarianism and development. The way that technology operates is a useful lens that highlights State practices, democracy, notions of power, and accountability. Technology is not inherently democratic and human rights impacts are particularly important to consider in humanitarian and forced migration contexts. An international human rights law framework is particularly useful for codifying and recognising potential harms, because technology and its development is inherently global and transnational. More oversight and issue-specific accountability mechanisms are needed to safeguard fundamental rights of migrants such as freedom from discrimination, privacy rights and procedural justice safeguards such as the right to a fair decision-maker and the rights of appeal. © 2019 The Author.","Artificial intelligence; Global governance; International human rights law; Migration; Migration management; New technologies",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Molnar, P.; University of TorontoCanada",,,"Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd.",,,,,23989173,,,,"English","Cambridge Int.

I pay particular attention to questions of agency, voice and individuation, and the mediation, distribution, or evacuation of these elements of subjectivity. In contrast to the indifference or outright hostility with which migrants and refugees have often been treated, a well-intentioned but Eurocentric trope, evident in Ode to Lesvos, is the attempt made by ‘ordinary’ citizens to offer hospitality to those arriving at the continent’s borders. On the other hand, Les Sauteurs (Those Who Jump) presents migrants’ own actions as in part a form of political resistance. Finally, I consider how Gianfranco Rosi’s Fuocoammare (Fire at Sea) and Thomas Østbye’s Imagining Emanuel interrogate the scrutiny, discipline and control endured by asylum seekers and migrants, processes that form part of the unmarked and unremarked upon Žižekian ‘objective violence’ that sustains the European system. These documentaries also offer reminders of the common technologies and routine procedures shared by filmmakers and the modern state’s legal apparatus, as both test veracity and attempt to produce the human subject as knowable. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","documentary; fortress Europe; migrants; Refugees",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2016) dir.

In this article, we critically evaluate that claim by developing a notion of deliberation along Habermasian lines, in which deliberation is understood as a process that induces negotiating partners to change positions through argumentation. Based on this conceptualization, we explore to what extent and under which conditions deliberation is likely to occur in intergovernmental settings. To that end, we analyse decision-making on the proposal to give law enforcement authorities access to the Visa Information System. We conclude that a ‘thicker’ conceptualization yields relatively few instances of deliberation. Moreover, we identify a number of specific conditions, and interrelationships between them, that are conducive to this kind of deliberation. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Constructivism; deliberation; European Union; Intergovernmentalism; Justice and Home Affairs (JHA); Visa Information System (VIS)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bickerton, C.J., Hodson, D., Puetter, U., The New Intergovernmentalism.

It attends to mobility and its obstructions, and the ways that coincide with bureaucratic, institutional, and everyday modes of sorting and racializing groups of people. Our case study is situated in Romania. Whereas “the Roma” do not exist as a category in the Romanian national registry of citizens, mainstream public discourses regarding “Roma migration” have significantly proliferated over the past decades. Yet, how do authorities come to know “the Roma” and how do they render groups of citizens into racialized populations? We examine two bureaucratic practices in Romania, the census and the registry of citizens, and show how the latter is enacted through various “technologies of vision.” We focus on the category of “the Roma” as a material semiotic configuration enacted by various “data” regarding issues such as territorial segregation, phenotypic appearance, smell, and dialect. Situated at the intersection of Border and Surveillance Studies, Romani Studies, and Science and Technologies Studies, this paper contributes to debates about how “the Roma” are rendered visible in practices of identification and migration management in Europe. © The Author(s) 2019.","border management; Europe; mobility; Racialization; Roma; technologies of vision","border region; bureaucracy; ethnic minority; ethnicity; mobility; policy approach; population migration; racial identity; Europe",,,,,"European Research Council, ERC","We would like to thank the Romanian Ministry of Administration and Interior for granting a research permit, and the employees of the Department of ?The Evidence of People and Administration of Databases? for hosting one of us during the fieldwork.

It locates, contains, and sorts individuals locally at the external borders of the EU and creates, inserts, and processes data for controlling people on the move. Based on ethnographic fieldwork in Greece, including interviews with local administrators from the Registration and Identification Service, Médecins du Monde, Frontex and Hellenic Police and a collection of internal and publicly available planning, policy, and management documents and handbooks, the paper scrutinizes how both the movement of migrants and data is organized at the site. By developing an analytic lens of logistics, it outlines a specific mode of infrastructuring which aligns staff from different organizations with databases, devices, and migrants all in one place and organizes mundane practices such as filling out forms, taking fingerprints, signing, and entering datasets along a chain. That way the hotspot is able to locate, sort, and detain those who arrive at the hardened EU border and to create a data infrastructure for controlling, monitoring, and governing further movement by processing data through the bureaucratic channels of the EU’s transnational control assemblages. © The Author(s) 2019.","Actor-Network Theory; border; control; data; infrastructure; logistics; migration","actor network theory; border region; bureaucracy; European Union; infrastructure planning; migration; territorial management; Greece; Moria",,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

The bordering practices of the European nation states have now both been dispersed into third countries and come to include frontline bureaucrats within the nation states, including social workers and healthcare staff. Without much public debate, healthcare and social welfare policies have become part of migration management policies. In the following, I explore new ways of understanding the relationship between borders, healthcare and the management of migrants in the welfare state of Norway. The article draws on fieldwork with migrants who have been irregularised after their asylum applications were rejected. I introduce the concept of ‘intimate borders’ to call attention to how irregular migrants are managed in the encounters between migrants and frontline bureaucrats such as healthcare workers. In these encounters, the legal status of the person becomes an ordering mode, and the potential disease to be treated becomes a subordinate object of concern. Everyday bordering practices are contingent not only on legal regulations and public discourses, but also on migrants’ habituation to and enactment of bordering practices. © 2018 European Association of Social Anthropologists","healthcare; intimate borders; irregular migrants; Norway; ‘petty sovereigns’",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, B., (2013) Us & them?

A vast infrastructure supports its visualization, making migration visible and actionable. Recent scholarship on the visuality of migration has clearly shown how visualizing migration is an integral part of governing it. Concepts and research approaches from Science and Technology Studies (STS) are particularly appropriate when studying these connections between knowing and doing. In this paper, the performativity of visual methods and their data practices are analysed with respect to the monitoring infrastructure of European border management. Three such methods – patrolling, recording and publicizing – are reconstructed through analysis of their histories and their present. Patrolling involves the tactical domination of terrains. Recording involves the production of documentary objectivity. Publicizing involves the pictorial capture of fleeting realities. These methods are irreducibly political. Their political significance is explored through the concept of demonstrative effects that helps to show how methods of visualising migration at once involve specific demonstrations of the European association that is operative in them. These demonstrations make visible what Europe can and cannot do. The so-called ‘migration crisis’ of Europe turns out to be more than political discourse but entangled with the very methods that render migration apparent and governable. © The Author(s) 2018.","borders; demonstration; Europe; Migration monitoring; performativity; visuality","border region; conceptual framework; migration; monitoring; political discourse; popular protest; Europe",,,,,"FP7 Ideas: European Research Council, IDEAS-ERC; European Commission, EC; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7","Above all, I would like to thank the people of Chios and Ermioni Frezouli in particular.

Summary tables provide information on legislative proposals considered in the 115th and 116th Congresses. Various legislative proposals have reflected a range of congressional perspectives and priorities, including with regard to • the authorization of the activities of the U.S. Armed Forces related to the conflict; • the extent of U.S. logistical, material, advisory, and intelligence support for the coalition led by Saudi Arabia; • the approval, disapproval, or conditioning of U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia; • the appropriation of funds for U.S. operations in support of the Saudi-led coalition; • the conduct of the Saudi-led coalition's air campaign and its adherence to international humanitarian law and the laws of armed conflict; • the demand for greater humanitarian access to Yemen; • the call for a wider government assessment of U.S. policy toward Yemen and U.S. support to parties to the conflict; • the nature and extent of U.S.-Saudi counterterrorism and border security cooperation; and • the role of Iran in supplying missile technology and other weapons to the forces of the Houthi movement. The 116th Congress may continue to debate U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition and Saudi Arabia's conduct of the war in Yemen, where fighting has continued since March 2015. The war has exacerbated a humanitarian crisis in Yemen that began in 2011; presently, the World Food Program reports that 20 million Yemenis face hunger in the absence of sustained food assistance. The difficulty of accessing certain areas of Yemen has made it hard for governments and aid agencies to count the war's casualties. Data collected by the U.S. and European-funded Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project (ACLED) suggest that 60,000 Yemenis have been killed since January 2016. The Trump Administration has opposed various congressional proposals, including initiatives to reject or condition proposed U.S. arms sales or to require an end to U.S. military support to Saudi-led coalition operations in Yemen. Many in Congress have condemned the October 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi government personnel, and in general, the incident appears to have exacerbated existing congressional concerns about Saudi leaders and the pace, scope, and direction of change in the kingdom's policies. This product includes legislative proposals considered during the 115th and 116th Congresses.

How did civil society actors coordinate their responses when national, regional, and global governance failed? This article begins by describing how civil society actors improvised their response through everyday coordination mechanisms defined as the informal processes for communication and decision making that make up the day-to-day action of implementation. Second, the article analyzes four examples of everyday coordination mechanisms: new technologies (like Facebook groups and Whatsapp chats), peer-to-peer refugee coordination, maps of services, and field-level working groups. Everyday coordination threatened state authority because it governed actors in a different way, created parallel systems, and sometimes promoted competing goals. The Greek government responded by institutionalizing, coopting, and cracking down on civil society actors helping refugees. © The Author(s) (2019).

Cultural Studies have been crucial in revealing how everyday, particularly media-oriented practices, make and unmake this ‘Fortress’. Yet, until now, the focus has been mostly on how migrants use or are represented through media discourses and technologies. This introduction essay argues that the signifier ‘Fortress Europe’—and its central premise of restraining mobility for some in order to enable freedom for others—also gains meaning in and through socio-cultural practices that we may not (as) immediately associate with the physical crossing of European borders. Particular practices that are discussed in this introduction and examined in the seven original articles of the special issue are: public opinion research, the public mobilization of emotions, negotiating identity in an ‘ancestral homeland’, the consumption of (sports) media, the production of a radio talk show and film archives, as well as the activist use of social media. Broadening scholarly attention to these kinds of sociocultural practices provides an important addition to understanding how power operates across social spheres and discursive orders. In addition, their identification also offers valuable opportunities to understand how and why some practices are particularly pertinent or effective in cementing or destabilizing Fortress Europe. This line of inquiry is visible throughout this special issue, despite the diversity of theoretical frameworks and empirical sites used in the contributing articles. © The Author(s) 2019.","borders; Cultural studies; discourse; Europe; liberal paradox; racism; social exclusion; socio-cultural practices",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bailey, O., Transnational identities and the media (2007) Transnational Lives and the Media, pp. 212-230. , Bailey O., Georgiou M., Harindranath R., (eds), London, Palgrave Macmillan, In:, (eds; Batha, E., Newspaper identifies 33,293 people who’ve died seeking shelter in ‘Fortress Europe’ (2017) Reuters, , https://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL8N1NG5KM, 10, November; Chouliaraki, L., Post-humanitarianism: Humanitarian communication beyond a politics of pity (2010) International Journal of Cultural Studies, 13 (2), pp. 107-126; Chouliaraki, L., Georgiou, M., Hospitability: The communicative architecture of humanitarian securitization at Europe’s borders (2017) Journal of Communication, 67 (2), pp. 159-180; UNHCR and Council of Europe leaders stress need to protect human rights of refugees (2015) Council of Europe, , https://www.coe.int/bg/web/portal/news-2015/-/asset_publisher/9k8wkRrYhB8C/content/unhcr-and-council-of-europe-leaders-stress-need-to-protect-human-rights-of-refugees?_101_INSTANCE_9k8wkRrYhB8C_languageId=en_GB, 4, September, accessed 4 June 2018; De Leeuw, S., Rydin, I., Migrant children’s digital stories: Identity formation and self-representation through media production (2007) European Journal of Cultural Studies, 10 (4), pp. 447-464; Dearden, L., Angela Merkel: Reintroducing border controls to stop migrants is not the ‘Europe we want’ (2015) The Independent, , https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/angela-merkel-reintroducing-border-controls-to-stop-migrants-is-not-the-europe-we-want-10481094.html, 1, September, accessed 4 June 2018; Engelbert, J., Awad, I., Securitizing cultural diversity: Dutch public broadcasting in post-multicultural and de-pillarized times (2014) Global Media and Communication, 10 (3), pp. 261-274; Acting as a union in the refugee crisis: Commission supports Austria (2015) European Commission, , http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_AC-16-1872_en.htm, 7, September, accessed 4 June 2018, (, a; Europe without borders: The Schengen area brochure (2015) European Commission, , https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/e-library/multimedia/publications/schengen-brochure_en, 20, December, accessed 4 June 2018, (, b; Grossberg, L., The cultural studies’ crossroads blues (1998) European Journal of Cultural Studies, 1 (1), pp. 65-82; Hall, A., Lichfield, J., Germany opens its gates: Berlin says all Syrian asylum-seekers are welcome to remain, as Britain is urged to make a ‘similar statement’ (2015) The Independent, , https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/germany-opens-its-gates-berlin-says-all-syrian-asylum-seekers-are-welcome-to-remain-as-britain-is-10470062.html, 25, August, accessed 4 May 2018; Hall, S., Cultural studies and its theoretical legacies (1992) Cultural Studies, pp. 277-294. , Grossberg L., Nelson C., Treichler P., (eds), London; New York, Routledge, In:, (eds; Hermes, J., Kooijman, J., Littler, J., On the move: Twentieth anniversary editorial of the European journal of cultural studies (2017) European Journal of Cultural Studies, 20 (6), pp. 595-605; Hollifield, J.F., (1992) Immigrants, Markets, and States: The Political Economy of Postwar Europe, , Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; Hollifield, J.F., The emerging migration state (2004) International Migration Review, 38 (3), pp. 885-912; Horsti, K., Visibility without voice: Media witnessing irregular migrants in BBC online news journalism (2016) African Journalism Studies, 37 (1), pp. 1-20; Huysmans, J., Security!

Since its establishment, the Schengen Visa has been an extraordinary example of the success of a borderless region and led to vibrant in growth and social development. ASEAN, as a new economic community that tries to set itself as a beneficiary of the lessons learned from the European Union, has been struggling in establishing its own common visa region. The reasons encompass economic, political, and social-cultural concerns. This study focuses specifically on the Lao PDR and it aims to assess the preparedness of the country if the region were to establish the common visa system. The study employs a qualitative approach and collects data via an interview questionnaire. Research data are collected from interviews of six high-ranking government officials. Using the theme generating and data coding approach in ATLAS, a qualitative data analysis program, this study found that the preparedness of the Lao PDR in implementing the ASEAN Common Visa (ACV) spans nine key factors: (1) geographical location, (2) visa policy, (3) immigration control, (4) quota of foreign workers in the private sector, (5) information and communications technology (ICT) in connectivity development, (6) electronic systems in the consular sector, (7) infrastructure, (8) population mobility, and (9) attitudes towards the ACV. After categorizing these factors based on economic, political, and social-cultural dimensions, it was found that population mobility is a common concern among the three dimensions. This suggests that the Lao PDR needs to focus on improvements in border management, synchronization of information and communication technology, infrastructure, and human resources development among the relevant sectors. © 2020 Sciedu Press.","ASEAN; Common visa; Economic; Lao PDR; Political-security; Social-cultural",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Albertin, G., (2007) Will a regional bloc enlarge?, pp. 7-69. , https://www.imf.Org/~/media/Websites/IMF/imported-full-text-pdf/external/pubs/ft/wp/2007/_wp0769.ashx, International Monetary Fund.

This reform, among other countless aspects, has increased the effective EU Information Management as the key to protect external borders, improve the management of migration flows and contribute to the enhancement of internal security. The applicable data protection legislation is significantly fragmented, complex and diffuse since, despite the GDPR excludes from its scope asylum-related activities, border control, and immigration is directly defined in the proposed Dublin IV, Procedures and Eurodac regulations. At the same time, the persistent linkages to the security of Member States can reflect the potential application of the Data Protection Directive on Police Matters. In addition, the interoperability of different information systems, the deployment of specific bodies (such as Frontex or EASO) as well as law enforcement authorities are bound directly by their own regulations. Consequently, this fragmented and particularly complex legal framework constitutes the subject of the study. © 2019 Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia.","Border security; CEAS reform; Data protection directive in in police matters; Dublin iv system; General data protection regulation; international protection; Protection and processing of asylum seekers personal data; Refugees; Subsidiary protection; UNHCR",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"García Mahamüt, R., La ductilidad del derecho a la protección internacional (refugio y protección subsidiaria) ante las crisis humanitarias: un desafío para Europa y para el Sistema Común de Asilo (2016) Teoría y Realidad Constitucional, (38), pp. 225 and 232; García Mahamüt, R., La ductilidad del derecho a la protección internacional Op. cit, pp. 211-238; López Aguilar, J.F., (2017) Europa: Parlamento y Derechos.

This reading means transcending the territorial aspect of a border - and its sense of sovereign affirmation - and looking at its functionality in terms of circulation being a matter for government, in what should be called the border's biopolitical decline. In this sense, government practices that define the border may be read in terms of the striation of space rather than the containment of a territory. The governance problem the border poses is one of reconciling porousness and selectivity. This encourages the construction of ""smart borders"" via innovations of a technological nature that essentially focus on the filtering capabilities of actuarial and biometric techniques. The paper addresses the transformations of this kind noted in the Schengen Area. © 2019, CIDOB (Barcelona centre for international affairs).","Border administration; European Union; Government; Mobility; Schengen Area; Smart border",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agamben, G., (2003) Homo Sacer.

But while its effects are well examined in migration and border studies, less is known about the intricate ways in which biometric bordering is politically negotiated and socio-technically put into practice. Therefore, in this paper, I trace the contested emergence of one particular scheme of biometric border control currently in the making: the EU’s Smart Borders Package. Proposed by the European Commission in 2013, it aims at digitally registering all third-country nationals’ entries to and exits from the Schengen area, while simultaneously accelerating the border crossing of certain travellers. I argue that, unlike other forms of biometric bordering, the Smart Borders Package problematises border control primarily on the level of its temporalities and constitutes the speed of border crossings, the timing of control as well as third-country nationals’ duration of stay as distinct objects of governing. Meanwhile, the project’s political negotiations have sparked techno-political controversies that repeatedly brought it to the brink of failure. Yet, these controversies have significantly enhanced the intelligibility and practicability of biometric bordering, contributing to the emergence of what I call the self-service border. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Biometrics; border control; EU smart border; technology; temporality","biometry; border region; European Union; immigration policy; international migration; technology adoption; Europe",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Amoore, L., Biometric Borders: Governing Mobilities in the War on Terror (2006) Political Geography, 25 (3), pp. 336-351; Barry, A., Technological Zones (2006) European Journal of Social Theory, 9 (2), pp. 239-253; Barry, A., Political Situations: Knowledge Controversies in Transnational Governance (2012) Critical Policy Studies, 6 (3), pp. 324-336; Bigo, D., Carrera, S., Hayes, B., Hernanz, N., Jeandesboz, J., (2012) Evaluating Current and Forthcoming Proposals on JHA Databases and a Smart Borders System at EU External Borders, , Brussels: European Parliament; Broeders, D., The New Digital Borders of Europe: EU Databases and the Surveillance of Irregular Migrants (2007) International Sociology, 22 (1), pp. 71-92; Broeders, D., A European ‘Border’ Surveillance System under Construction (2011) Migration and the New Technological Borders of Europe, pp. 40-67. , Dijstelbloem H., Meijer A., (eds), Basingstoke: Palgrave MacMillan,. edited by; Broeders, D., Hampshire, J., Dreaming of Seamless Borders: ICTs and the Pre-emptive Governance of Mobility in Europe (2013) Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, 39 (8), pp. 1201-1218; Carrera, S., Hernanz, N., Re-framing Mobility and Identity Controls: The Next Generation of the EU Migration Management Toolkit (2015) Journal of Borderlands Studies, 30 (1), pp. 69-84; Casas-Cortes, M., Cobarrubias, S., de Genova, N., Garelli, G., Grappi, G., Heller, C., Hess, S., New Keywords: Migration and Borders (2015) Cultural Studies, 29 (1), pp. 55-87; Collyer, M., de Haas, H., Düvell, F., Critical Approaches to Transit Migration (2012) Population, Space and Place, 18 (4), pp. 407-414; (2013), Outcome of Proceedings from Strategic Committee on Immigration, Frontiers and Asylum (SCIFA) on 21 November 2013. 17127/13; (2013), Outcome of Proceedings of Working Party on Frontiers on 28-29 May 2013. 11143/13; (2014), Approach for the Way Forward on the Smart Borders Package. 5828/14; (2014), The Scope of the Study on the Smart Borders Package. 6993/14; Dean, M., (2010) Governmentality: Power and Rule in Modern Society, , 2nd ed, London: : Sage; Dijstelbloem, H., Broeders, D., Border Surveillance, Mobility Management and the Shaping of Non-publics in Europe (2015) European Journal of Social Theory, 18 (1), pp. 21-38; Dijstelbloem, H., Meijer, A., (2011) Migration and the New Technological Borders of Europe, , Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, and, eds; Epstein, C., Guilty Bodies, Productive Bodies, Destructive Bodies: Crossing the Biometric Borders (2007) International Political Sociology, 1 (2), pp. 149-164; Eule, T.G., Loher, D., Wyss, A., Contested Control at the Margins of the State (2018) Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, 44 (16), pp. 2717-2729; (2015), Testing the Borders of the Future.

This article transposes on-site border malfunctions into the antecedent register of research and development in order to explore how failure operates in the design, construction and testing of a border security technology. Drawing from extensive ethnographic research of a European-wide project to develop the Handhold portable chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive (CBRNE) detector, this article traces how failure is mobilized as an instructive experience in the professional cultures of science, engineering and governance, and retrospectively narrated as a necessary step on the road to eventual success. In exploring the limitations of this understanding, the article demonstrates how competing experiences of failure constantly trouble the daily routines of scientists and engineers, shape informal de-risking strategies, and fuel the relentless pursuit of innovation. To contest the dominant account of failure as an instructive experience, the article argues that more creative and critical research into the heterogeneous life-worlds of failure is needed in order to politicize the consequences of border failures and connect them to the antecedent register of scientific research and development. © The Author(s) 2017.","Borders; failure; innovation; risk; security; technology",,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/K011332/1; Universiteit van Amsterdam, UvA: 02/2015, 09/2014","I would like to thank: the participants of the workshop ?Security/Mobility ?

We argue that border security drones have contrary political, policy, and ethical implications. First, the encroachment of military technologies into non-military security operations may have adverse security repercussions, but drones may also save migrants' lives as they make dangerous journeys through deserts and across rough seas. Second, drone surveillance erodes privacy but also creates new accountability mechanisms. Finally, drones may obviate some visible signs of security, such as fences, while also introducing an invisible security apparatus that extends beyond state boundaries. These contradictory effects help to explain the complex policy formation processes underlying drone border security programs in the United States and Europe, as well as the challenge of reaching clear answers about whether drone security is desirable. © The Author(s) (2018).

All rights reserved.Este artículo analiza el complejo panorama de seguridad que se está desarrollando debido a los drones militares que utilizan los estados para vigilar las fronteras y al hecho de que actores no estatales con motivaciones marcadamente distintas están desarrollando sus propios sistemas de vigilancia con drones. Afirmamos que los drones destinados a la vigilancia de las fronteras tienen implicaciones políticas, éticas y reglamentarias opuestas. En primer lugar, la intrusión de las tecnologías militares en las operaciones de seguridad no militares puede tener repercusiones negativas en materia de seguridad, pero al mismo tiempo, los drones pueden salvar las vidas de los inmigrantes que emprenden un peligroso viaje en el que cruzan desiertos y mares embravecidos. En segundo lugar, la vigilancia con drones reduce la privacidad, pero también permite crear nuevos mecanismos de responsabilidad. Por último, los drones pueden pasar por alto señales visibles de seguridad, como las vallas, a la vez que introducen un sistema de vigilancia invisible que va más allá de las fronteras nacionales. Estos efectos contradictorios ayudan a explicar los complejos procesos de creación de políticas que están detrás de los programas de vigilancia de las fronteras con drones de Estados Unidos y Europa, así como el desafío de obtener respuestas claras acerca de la idoneidad de la seguridad con drones. © The Author(s) (2018).

In contrast to conventional point-to-point interconnectors, the extension creates a meshed submarine grid (MSG) which includes an interconnector and wind farm collectors to the countries using the same equipment. Denmark East as part of the Nordic system and 50 Hertz as part of the synchronous Continental European grid are asynchronous to each other, which makes a frequency transformation necessary. The interconnection will be realised by a high-voltage direct current (HVDC) back-to-back (BtB) converter in voltage source converter technology located at the German end of the interconnector. The BtB and the entire HVAC MSG between Denmark and Germany will be controlled by a so-called master controller for interconnector operation (MIO). The KF CGS will integrate offshore wind power generation, increase the security of supply and enhance integration of regionally produced renewable energy. This study describes the overall infrastructure of the KF CGS and the MIO functions.

This paper seeks to understand what role various surveillance technologies, such as radar, satellites, and unmanned aerial vehicles, can play in this respect (legally and technically), in comparison to the role that they are assigned (that is, political expectations). To unravel what surveillance technologies can and cannot do vis-à-vis the aims of control and rescue, there is a need to comprehend what information can be collected and what information is needed to fulfil these objectives. The paper contends that there is a mismatch between the information sought to ‘control’ borders, but which cannot be gathered effectively by or processed using surveillance technologies, and the valuable information needed to perform rescue operations, which these surveillance technologies can supply. © 2018 The Author(s).

Through a case study of Spain's SIVE (Sistema Integrado de Vigilancia del Exterior) surveillance system, I tease apart the Guardia Civil's technocratic claims of omni-voyance by focusing on the daily interactions between border guards, vision technologies, rescue services, Moroccan forces, and the lively materials of the borderspace itself. I employ a literary narrative in order to expose the daily breaches of control as the guards and technologies contend with the non-human elements of the borderspace, as well as their own inability to remain vigilant. Far from offering unbroken control, therefore, I argue that the vision produced through SIVE is stuttered and fragmented through both human and technological flaws. I also draw on assemblage theory in order to trace the disparate actors being drawn into the border regime. I argue that these new actors are only ever partially encountered and incorporated, however, and that as a result the system's ability to incorporate also becomes its Achilles heel. The effect is a geography of the border that foregrounds the ‘little details’ of borderwork and the volatility of the borderspace itself – thus exposing the flaws behind a scopic narrative that claims unceasing vision and an unhindered reach. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,"border region; maritime boundary; political geography; surveillance and enforcement; territorial management; territoriality; theoretical study; Spain",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adey, P., Aerial Life: Spaces, mobilities, affects (2010), Wiley-Blackwell Chichister; Ajana, B., Governing through biometrics: The biopolitics of identity (2013), Palgrave Macmillan Basingstoke; Alarm Phone, In solidarity with migrants at sea!

During the project execution, a mobile device supporting biometric recognition (face and fingerprint) and passport checking was designed and developed. To test this new equipment under an operational environment, a usability evaluation was carried out in the Sculeni border control (border of Romania with Moldavia), being the operators Romanian Policemen and the data subjects' real volunteer travelers. The equipment was used for 2 days under different conditions in real scenarios, and the usability evaluation carried out follows the ISO 9241-11:1998 standard. A total of 93 participants completed the new border checking and fulfilled a satisfaction survey at the end of the experiment. This paper describes the evaluation and reports some preliminary results on the user-Automatic Border Control system interaction and the final conclusions obtained at the end of the project, resulting in a valuable guide for designing user interaction in security areas. © 2013 IEEE.","Border control; evaluation; face recognition; fingerprint recognition; human computer interaction (HCI)","Automobiles; Face recognition; ISO Standards; Mobile devices; Palmprint recognition; Pattern recognition; Reliability; Surveys; Border control; Europe; evaluation; Fingerprint Recognition; Human Computer Interaction (HCI); Security; Usability; Human computer interaction",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2017) IATA-IATA Reveals Checkpoint of the Future, , http://www.iata.org/pressroom/pr/Pages/2011-06-07-01.aspx, [Online].

We look at the military-humanitarian mode of migration management that this operation performs from three vantage points: logistics, with a focus on the infrastructure of migrant travels; subjectivity, looking at the migrant profiles this operation works through; and epistemology, building on the mission's first stage of intelligence and data gathering. Through this multi-focal approach, we illuminate the productivity of this military-humanitarian approach to the migration crisis in the Mediterranean. © 2017 The Author.

As part of a securitisation process, these measures are often expanded upon and justified in terms of economic threat that aims to restrain ‘opportunist Central East European migrants’, who are associated with welfare dependence and cheap labour. Although unemployed Roma migrants are exposed to social exclusion due to the stigma of ‘benefit shoppers’, this paper explores how current neoliberal labour market structures facilitate new securitisation processes and fuel the precarity of Roma, even if they are employed in the host country. Based on a multi-sited ethnography completed in The United Kingdom, it will be illustrated how communitarianism of Member States stratifies the moral values of migrants’ labour in a manner that defines the preconditions of social inclusion of newcomers in host societies. In short, this paper argues that even for migrants who are not welfare dependent and who are self-sustaining, their social inclusion is defined by engagement in the sort of labour that is culturally acknowledged by the host society. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.","communitarianism; precarity; securitisation; social sorting",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Albert, R., Schneeweis, A., Knobbe, I., Strengthening, hiding or relinquishing ethnic identity in response to threat: Implications for intercultural relations (2005) Intercultural Communication Studies, 14 (1), pp. 107-118; Anderson, B., (2013) Us and Them?

I argue that this economy of suspicion builds on and partakes in a governmental regulation that result in a stratification of rights. After outlining how Western romantic love has a history that cannot be uncoupled from state concerns about race and citizenship, I detail how Didier Fassin’s notion of moral economy of suspicion relates to technologies of love in the governmentality of marriage migration. Finally, I examine recent legislation and policing practices in the UK to illustrate how technologies of love can become part of judgment formation in evaluating possibly suspicious couples, notably European citizens marrying non-European citizens. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","governmentality; love; Marriage migration; moral economy of suspicion; security; sham marriages; United Kingdom","immigration; management practice; marriage; political economy; state role; United Kingdom",,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada: 435-2014-1794","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work is supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (Grant/Award Number: Insight Research Grant #435-2014-1794).",,,,,,,,,,"Ahlstedt, S., (2016) The Feeling of Migration: Narratives of Queer Intimacies and Partner Migration, , Linköping University, Linköping; Balzacq, T., (2011) Securitization Theory: How Security Problems Emerge and Dissolve, , Milon Park/New York, NY, Routledge; http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-18384543, BBC News (2012) Theresa May to give judges new deportation guidance.

While the special assistance provided to disabled passengers has improved in the last decade, some may want to travel independently using automated gates. This is currently not possible, nor is there an explicit plan to include the accessibility requirement in future technology development. We reflect this questionable situation against the notion of the good society and consider airports as normatively laden socio-physical zones contributing to experiences of exclusion. Our research stresses the need to consider human abilities as a spectrum, which should be addressed with the use of universal design principles to benefit as many travelers as possible. Interviews and a survey of disabled passengers help us explore the views of stakeholders; to find out whether persons with disabilities wish to use automated systems instead of assistance services, and whether stakeholders consider accessible systems technologically possible, cost-effective, and recommendable. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Accessibility; Air travel; Automated border control; Biometric technology; The good society; Universal design","Control systems; Cost effectiveness; Design; Disabled persons; Man machine systems; Accessibility; Air travels; Biometric technology; Border control; The good society; Universal Design; Automation; accessibility; air transportation; airport; biometry; border region; disability; stakeholder; technology adoption",,,,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7: 312583; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7","This work has received funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007–2013) under grant agreement n° 312583 (FastPass).

Digital migration studies is an emerging interdisciplinary field focussed on studying migration in, through and by means of the internet. As the so-called European refugee crisis demonstrates, the scale, intensities and types of transnational migration and digital networking have drastically changed in recent years. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have fundamentally transformed migration processes and vice versa. Top-down management of migration flows and border control is increasingly dependent on digital technologies and datafication, while from the bottom-up migrants use smart phones and apps to access information, maintain transnational relations, establish local connections and send remittances. In the first half of the chapter, drawing on (Candidatu et al., 2018) we distinguish between three paradigms of digital migration studies: (1) migrants in cyberspace; (2) everyday digital migrant life; (3) migrants as data. In the second half of the chapter, we offer the methodological research principles of relationality, adaptability and ethics-of-care to operationalize digital migration studies with a commitment to social justice. Challenging unjust power relations is important both when studying vulnerable groups as well as studying elites. The many experiences, obstacles and opportunities we found in the literature reveal that the future of digital migration studies lies at the intersection of big and small data, there is great urgency in triangulating quantified patterns with in-depth narrative accounts and situated experiences. © The Author(s) 2018.","Digital Migration; Digital Practices; Emerging Research Focus; European Refugee Crisis; Information And Communication Technologies (ICTs)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Appadurai, A., (1996) Modernity at Large.

At the same time, the author focuses on studying the legal framework, as well as the key elements of this policy. Author believes that the system of EU legal acts regulating visa relations should be qualified as EU visa legislation, which is one of the elements of a larger system of legal acts in the field of freedom of movement of persons. The EU visa policy has two key areas: the establishment of a visa / visa-free entry regime; the establishment of the procedure and conditions for issuing short stay visas. The latter area also includes issues related to the functioning of the Visa Information System. Currently, the EU realizes the reform of the visa policy, which covers both its directions. The analysis of the ongoing reform shows that the EU, on the one hand, seeks to strengthen external borders by creating additional control mechanisms, and. on the other hand, as a compensatory measure, creates more comfortable conditions for the entry of frequent and law-abiding travelers. © 2018 Institute of Europe Russian Academy of Sciences.

In this regard, this article examines the EU’s strategy and rationalisations to develop dual-use technologies such as aerial surveillance drones for border management. By drawing on critical security and technology studies and by focusing on their functional technological efficiency, the article argues that drones are being normalised in a technological regime of exclusion at the border-zone. It further contends that high-end technologies such as drones introduce a military bias as security enablers in border surveillance and as a panacea for the consequences of failed policies to manage irregular migration. A closer examination of several EU-endorsed drone projects reveals a pragmatic and industry-driven approach to border security, underlining the evolving homogenisation between internal and external security and the imminent “dronisation” of European borders. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","border security; drones; European Union; FRONTEX; technological efficiency",,,,,,"Israel Aerospace Industries, IAI; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7","The author would like to thank Daniel Fiott and the other participants at the EUIA 2018 panel for their helpful feedback. The author is also grateful to Chantal Lavall?e and the two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments.","Overall, the EU-level strategies to test and invest in drone projects could be construed as an instance of preventive and fortress-type protectionist tactics of bordering, deterrence, and exclusion. There is an overt tendency to prioritise high technologies such as drones in border management and the adoption of so-called “robot armies at the EU’s borders” (Hayes ). The EU’s FP7 structural funds for security research have been allocated to defence consortia, including Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), Sagem, Dassault Aviation, Thales, Airbus Group, Bae System, and Finmeccanica (now Leonardo S.p.A.). Rules have generally prohibited defence companies from tapping research grants under the structural funds schemes for the specific funding of military-oriented research projects. The concept of dual-use technologies has managed to circumvent such rules, covering equipment development such as dual-use drone technologies for both civilian and military objectives. To illustrate this point, the following section tackles several EU-endorsed drone projects under the EU’s framework programmes.",,,,,,,,,"Adey, P., Whitehead, M., Williams, A.J., (2013) From above: war, violence, and verticality, , London: Hurst Publishers; (2015) Autonomous Dronistics for Security (ADS): optimised services with fleets of flying robots, , https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/196256_en.html, Available from: [Accessed 30 April 2018]; (2017) Aerial insights: facilitating access to aerial drone imagery services through novel and cost-effective data analytics solutions, , https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/213301_en.html, Available from: [Accessed 30 April 2018]; (2013) UAV based innovative means for land and sea non-cooperative vehicles stop, , http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/106475_en.html, Available from: [Accessed 30 April 2018]; Akhter, M., The proliferation of peripheries: militarised drones and the reconfiguration of global space (2017) Progress in human geography, 20 (X), pp. 1-17; Akkerman, M., (2016), https://www.tni.org/en/publication/border-wars-ii, Border Wars: the arms dealers profiting from Europe’s refugee tragedy.

Based on preliminary observations on one of the receiving islands, it analyzes some of the unintended consequences of the EU-Turkey Agreement, including the increased xenophobia among the Greek population, as well as the increased use of technology by migrants to evade border control and to facilitate migration. Joel Millman of the International Organization for Migration corroborates that when Syrians arrive in Italy or Greece “they just melt away at the pier-they get on Facebook, and they know where to go”. The chapter argues that the outcomes of the EU-Turkish Agreement signal a gap between the intended and unintended consequences of the EU’s efforts to stem migratory flows. The EU-Turkey Agreement that closed the Aegean Route turned islanders’ compassion to aggravation. © 2019 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2016) Female Refugees Face Physical Assault, Exploitation and Sexual Harassment on Their Journey through Europe., , www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/01/female-refugees-face-physical-assaultexploitation-and-sexual-harassment-on-their-journey-through-europe/, January 18.

Spurred on by the events of 9/11 and, later, the phenomena of the so-called Islamic state and of ‘foreign terrorist fighters’, states and international institutions have introduced laws and policies that encroach greatly on fundamental freedoms and human rights, and the international conception of the ‘rule of law’ has been ‘securitized’ to a striking degree so that it now increasingly suggests ‘strong’ institutions capable of effective coercion rather than necessarily limited, transparent and rights-bound institutions, answerable to ‘the People’. Domestic and international counter-terrorism measures include provisions to permit, require and fund technologically innovative approaches to counter-terrorism. Thus, surveillance, smart borders, data collection and sharing, passenger name record exchange and so on feature heavily in the highly technologized arena of contemporary counter-terrorism where the production, retention, processing and deployment of data have taken centre stage. While these measures raise particular questions flowing from the technologies applied, this chapter takes a step back from the specifics of technological innovation in security to address a matter of structural, ethical and deliberative concern across the field of security: effectiveness. In the field of counter-terrorism, evaluation of whether counter-terrorist measures are actually effective is worryingly inadequate or, sometimes, simply nonexistent. Given the implications of expansive counter-terrorism for human rights, democracy and the Rule of Law, I will argue that the evaluation of effectiveness is fundamental in maintaining the legitimacy of the counter-terrorist state and supra-state. Having done that, I will explore what the notion of ‘effectiveness’ means in this context, identifying both meta-and specific objectives as critical sites of analysis. Based on this, the chapter will argue for the implementation of critical, reflexive and comprehensive ex post facto effectiveness evaluation of counter-terrorist measures, going well beyond a mere analysis of ‘legality’ per se. Where done properly, such evaluation should enhance legitimacy, not least by identifying areas where the infringement of personal liberty resulting from a counter-terrorism measure is disproportionate to its apparent effectiveness in enhancing security. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, J.

Beyond those issues, however, biometrics poses challenges regarding the very definition of the human and the body. The so called ""failures to enroll"" at capturing biometric data reveal a construction of the ""normal"" body, while other bodies appear as less technologically compatible. This construction is reproducing assumptions that are deeply engraved in the Eurocentric imaginary, where the non-European other is constructed as being closer to ""nature"". At the same time, it reveals the realm towards which contemporary border struggles and the possibility of contestation and resistance are being displaced, namely the very own body. © Revista de pensamiento e investigación social 2018.","Body; Borders; Subjectivity; Technology",,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","1 La investigación que sirvió de base a este artículo contó entre 2013 y 2017 con el apoyo del Centro de Epcelencia Bases Culturales de la Integración Social de la Universidad de Constanza, auspiciado por la Fundación Científca Alemana (DFG).",,,,,,,,,,"Agamben, G., (1998) Homo Sacer, , El poder soberano y la nuda vida.

What the notion of appropriation better captures than concepts like agency or resistance is the multi-faceted and intricate intertwinement of border regimes and migratory practices. The article illustrates this advantage through an analysis of the phenomenon of bezness. The term refers to a migration strategy of aspiring migrants who seduce and subsequently marry European tourists as a way to gain entry to and residency in Europe. This article develops a reading of bezness as a mode of appropriation of mobility which is intertwined with the border regime in at least four ways: First, bezness is provoked by restrictive visa policies that create a highly unequal access to mobility and life opportunities. The case of bezness illustrates, second, that migrants try to recode the methods, logics and effects of mobility control into means of appropriation. Migrants' practices of appropriation involve, third, the clandestine transgression of the norms, rules and regulations that define particular border regimes. Finally, the notion of appropriation permits to recognize that the European border regime operates as an apparatus of capture that tries to recuperate migrants' practices in order to turn them into a driving force for its own development. The example of bezness demonstrates, moreover, that these processes of recuperation also feature the mobilization of emotions-in this case of romantic love-as technologies of government. © The Author 2017.

The ways in which the emerging transnational policies of migration management are actually put into practice and are thereby shaped by implementing actors, as well as the contexts to which they have been applied, have received less attention. Against this background, the article turns to the IOM's contested implementation of migration management in Morocco. As such, it aims to extend the dominant focus of most studies on state and EU institutions, their policy, discourse and decision making towards the border zones in which their practical outcome and meaning is negotiated. Using the example of two projects implemented by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), it reconstructs the negotiation processes of international migration management on the ground. Based on the analysis of emerging control practices in Morocco, the article shows how humanitarian and neoliberal logics of governing migration complement existing security-oriented policies and, as such, contribute to the (re)stabilization and expansion of the trans- Mediterranean migration regime in times of fading legitimacy. With theoretical reference to the concept of a migration regime, the article argues that these reconfigurations are neither the result of a centrally directed 'EUropean masterplan' nor of a linear evolution towards more sophisticated control technologies but the contingent outcome of struggles between migration movements and the political and administrative attempts to control them. © The Author 2017.

Based on an analysis of documents published by EU institutions and independent organizations, I argue that these technological innovations fundamentally alter the nature of national borders. I discuss how new technologies of vision are deployed to transcend the physical limits of territories. In the last twenty years, EU member states and institutions have increasingly relied on various forms of remote tracking, including the use of drones for the purposes of monitoring frontier zones. In combination with other facets of the EU border management regime (such as transnational databases and biometrics), these technologies coalesce into a system of governance that has enabled intervention into neighboring territories and territorial waters of other states to track and target migrants for interception in the “prefrontier.” For jurisdictional reasons, this practice effectively precludes the enforcement of legal human rights obligations, which European states might otherwise have with regard to these persons. This article argues that this technologically mediated expansion of vision has become a key feature of post–cold war governance of borders in Europe. The concept of transterritory is proposed to capture its effects. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","borders; drones; European Union; Eurosur; surveillance",,,,,,"Heinrich Böll Stiftung; European Chemical Industry Council, Cefic; European Commission; European Parliament","Building on my own research on European responses to boat disasters on the Mediterranean (Follis 2015) and on the work of others who show how EU border policies exacerbate the migratory crisis (Albahari 2015; Mountz and Loyd 2014; Human Rights Watch [HRW] 2009; Weber and Pickering 2011; Spijkerboer 2007), I ask, how and for whom are jurisdictional boundaries manipulated? What are the legal and political benefits of these shifts and who is hoping to reap them? To answer these questions, I draw on science and technology studies and surveillance studies literature to develop a theoretical account of Eurosur as a system of “situated surveillance” (Gad and Lauritsen 2009). I set it in the context of the post-1989 history of bordering in Europe, as I present evidence from a selection of published statements and reports on its function and projected development. The empirical data I consider originate from (a) independent watchdogs and nongovernmental organizations (Statewatch, the Heinrich Böll Foundation), (b) the European Parliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), and (c) EU institutions themselves (European Commission, Frontex).3",,,,,,,,,,"Agnew, J., Sovereignty Regimes: Territoriality and State Authority in Contemporary World Politics (2005) Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 95 (2), pp. 437-461; Albahari, M., (2015) Crimes of Peace.

With effect, from 7 April, a new EU rule (Regulation 2017/458) has reinforced checks against relevant databases at external borders. This makes checking EU citizens and their travel documents against databases compulsory, enhanced with biometric checks where needed. It means that at the border gates, instead of checking EU citizens randomly, they should all be checked. The solutions identified by the project include the pre-arrival registration and the biometric identification of people to speed up the process1 and wearable intelligent border control equip­ment that will allow the capacity for control to be enlarged, even where the infrastructure can­not be physically extended by increasing the head­count of the border control force. The Intelligent Portable Control System pro­ject has led to a series of findings about the best application of different biometric modalities in border control. The project has also explored the issues around introducing these innovations. The imple­mentation process is complex, encompassing not only novel biometric solutions but also related biometric analytics, detection and com­munication tools. Consequently, and based on the results of the end user requirements collection, the project assumes the implementation of a face-matching tool, palm vein scanner, fingerprint recognition and an automatic deception detection system. Biometric technologies offer a potential solution to deliver high security lev­els while minimising the impact on travellers’ transit time. The proposed Intelligent Portable Control System aims to achieve this, enabling faster and more thorough border control for third-country nationals crossing the land borders of EU member states.",,"Control systems; Pattern recognition; Biometric checks; Biometric identifications; Biometric technology; Deception detection; End user requirements; Fingerprint Recognition; Terrorist threats; Travel documents; Biometrics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Balla, J., (2013), ‘Applying Biometric Data for Personal Identification’.

Building on the border security as practice research agenda, the analysis focuses on the production, circulation, and consumption of scarce forms of knowledge. To explore situated knowledge of border security practices, I develop an approach to multi-sited event ethnography to observe and interpret knowledge that may be hard to access at the security fairs. The analysis focuses on mechanisms for disseminating and distributing scarce forms of knowledge, technological materializations of situated knowledge, expressions of transversal knowledge of security problems, how masculinities structure knowledge in gendered ways, and how unease is expressed through imagined futures in order to anticipate emergent solutions to proposed security problems. The article concludes by reflecting on the contradictions at play at fairs and how to address such contradictions through alternative knowledges and practices. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Border security; critical anthropology of security; practice; security fairs; security industry",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Amicelle, A., Aradau, C., Jeandesboz, J., Questioning security devices: Performativity, resistance, politics (2015) Security Dialogue, 46 (4), pp. 293-306; Andersson, R., Europe’s failed ‘fight’ against irregular migration: Ethnographic notes on a counterproductive industry (2016) Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, 42 (7), pp. 1055-1075. , a); Andersson, R., Hardwiring the frontier?

This article engages with what we call the ‘operative vision’ of surveillance at sea, specifically as performed by the border control apparatus in the Aegean. We analyse the political consequences of this operative vision by elaborating on three examples of fieldwork conducted in the Aegean and on the islands of Chios and Lesbos. One of the main aims is to bring the figure of the migrant back into the study of border technologies. By combining insights from science and technology studies with border, mobility and security studies, the article distinguishes between processes of intervention, mobilization and realization and emphasizes the role of migrants in their encounter with surveillance operations. Two claims are brought forward. First, engaging with recent scholarly work on the visual politics of border surveillance, we circumscribe an ongoing ‘transactional politics’. Second, the dynamic interplay between vision and action brings about a situation of ‘recalcitrance’, in which mobile objects and subjects of various kinds are drawn into securitized relations, for instance in encounters between coast guard boats and migrant boats at sea. Without reducing migrants to epiphenomena of those relations, this recalcitrance typifies the objects of surveillance as both relatable as well as resistant, particularly in the tensions between border control and search and rescue. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Aegean; border surveillance; irregular migration; politics; visualization",,,,,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7: 283679",,,,,,,,,,,"Adey, P., Anderson, B., Graham, S., Introduction.

Although both countries have important agreements to promote economic exchange and trade, the events of 9/11 and other acts of terrorism have increased concerns about border security. Since the US-Mexico border is one of the most important borders in the world in terms of activity, securing it without interfering with the legitimate flow of people and goods, poses an important challenge. The purpose of this paper is to propose conceptual frameworks and models to facilitate collaboration across national borders, by discussing and considering key factors for collaborative US-Mexico Border Security Infrastructure and Systems. Border security technical solutions pose an interesting domain because there are a myriad of concerns (e.g., political, economic, social and cultural) outside the technical implementation that must be deliberated and examined. In this conceptual study, unique aspects of trust, governance, information sharing, culture, and technical infrastructure are identified as the key ingredients in a cross-border collaboration effort. A bi-national organizational network appears to be an effective institutional design to develop a better understanding of the problem, as well as required policies and technologies. This approach is consistent with experiments, research, and conclusions found in the European Union. © 2017 by IGI Global.

The program was established to improve United States border security by creating an integrated system that tracks the entrance and exits of all foreign nationals who travel to the United States. The initial plans for an automated entry and exit control system originated in 1996 with the United States Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. It was, however, the unique circumstances created by the events of 9/11 that provided the impetus and momentum that allowed the United States to aggressively pursue an updated version of this program – US-VISIT – with liĴle pushback from inside or outside the country. With the US-VISIT program, the United States has staked its claim in driving global adoption of biometrics for border control, accelerating the adoption of biometrics and other identification-related technologies for this purpose as it drives national programs across Europe, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. © 2007 David G.W.

These hearings offer a wealth of information concerning the details of Snowden's claims, their implications for privacy rights, and the way in which the transatlantic political dialogue on these issues is unfolding. However, they have yet to receive academic attention. This article suggests that the LIBE Hearings were an important platform that rendered the contested Snowden files into public evidence of contemporary surveillance practices. Drawing on the concept of ""material publics"" proposed by Noortje Marres and others, we examine how the material setting of LIBE was crucial to the ways in which the Snowden files were made public in Europe. Valid evidence was produced, legal issues were identified, technological solutions were fostered, and responsibilities were enacted and denied.",,,,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; European Research Council, ERC: 682317","Many thanks to participants at the ""Foucault and European Studies"" workshop at Kiel University for their comments and suggestions, especially Luis Lobo-Guerrero and Didier Bigo.

Taking seriously the generative and world-making capacities of contemporary algorithms, this special issue draws attention to the embodied actions of algorithms as they extend cognition, agency and responsibility beyond the conventional sites of the human, the state and sovereignty. Though focusing on different modes of algorithmic security, each of the contributions to the special issue shares a concern with what it means to claim security on the terrain of incalculable and uncertain futures. To secure with algorithms is to reorient the embodied relation to uncertainty, so that human and non-human cognitive beings experimentally generate and learn what to bring to the surface of attention for a security action. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Algorithms; decision; security; technology; violence",,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/K000276/1; Leverhulme Trust; Research Councils UK, RCUK; Durham University","The authors acknowledge the editors and anonymous reviewers of Security Dialogue for their insightful comments; Claudia Aradau for first persuading us, in a Toronto café, to edit this special issue; Volha Piotukh, Sarah Hughes, Alice Cree, Peter Forman and Vanessa Schofield for their work in support of Durham University workshops at which some of these articles were first presented; and finally, the contributors to the special issue who have generously committed their work and creative energies.

This will be followed – using the European Border Surveillance System as a case-study – with an examination of how militarized pre-emptive logics, with evident affinities to those emerging from the ‘Revolution in Military Affairs’, inform the design and operationalization of informatized and militarized border control. The chapter examines how the ‘virtual border’ is militarized, drawing upon Amoore’s notion of ‘algorithmic war’. The militarization of the border through naval interdiction practices is evident in other borderzones, notably in the USA and Australia. The advent of high-technology border surveillance systems that integrate hardware and software evidences how border militarization is both material and virtual. The chapter concludes with a consideration of the limits, trends and consequences of high-technology border militarization in the Global North. © 2015 selection and editorial material, Sharon Pickering and Julie Ham.

Beginning with an analysis of the defined threats and solutions to border security, the chapter discusses three new technologically-oriented control systems: surveillance, biometrics, and information technology. In the case of the United States, the Bush administration has launched a ""Smart Borders"" program designed to screen for terrorist incursions into the United States at air and land ports of entry (POE). Thomas A. Birkland theoretical framework, first developed around natural disasters, seeks to understand policy changes after focusing events. Epistemic communities help formulate the solution set endorsed in response to a focusing event. Biometrics are automated methods of recognizing humans, based on unique physiological or behavioral characteristics. The chapter concludes on a cautionary note by highlighting some of the issues securing through technology presents. © 2004 by Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Eliot, T.S., Choruses from ‘The Rock (1962) Collected Poems, p. 107. , New York: Harvest/Harcourt; Skolnikoff, E.B., (1993) The Elusive Transformation: Science, Technology, and the Evolution of International Politics, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Robinson, J., Technology, Change, and the Emerging International Order (1995) SAIS Review, 15 (1), pp. 153-173; Ostry, S., Nelson, R.R., (1995) Techno-Nationalism and Techno-Globalism: Conflict and Cooperation, , Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution Press; Waever, O., Buzan, B., Kelstrup, M., Kemaitre, P., (1993) Identity, Migration, and the New Security Agenda in Europe, , New York: St. Martin’s Press; Buzan, B., Security, the State, the ‘New World Order,’ and Beyond On Security; Lipshutz, R.D., (1995) On Security, , On Security Ronnie D.

This chapter analyzes the appetite for identification and identity in the context of a post-bipolar, post-Westphalian and globalized world. It examines how it is intrinsically related to the transformations of security preoccupations and to the perceptions of the enemy in the new context as well as to the fear of the unknown and uncertainty. Schengen Information System (SIS) is a computerized information system on persons, stolen vehicles, and objects for the use of border control authorities, customs, and national police. It relies on increased policing behind borders and extensive cross-border police cooperation between Schengen members. The chapter asserts that the enhanced development of identification and surveillance technologies leads to the creation of what Laudon calls a ""dossier society"". It concludes by stressing the shift to a new form of surveillance generated by these transformations. © Didier Bigo and Elspeth Guild 2005.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ceyhan, A.; University of ParisFrance; email: ayseceyhan@hotmail.com",,,"Taylor and Francis",,,,,,9781351948715; 9780754630111,,,"English","Controlling Frontiers: Free Movement Into and Within Europe",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082273333

This includes the use of automated border control (ABC) systems. The Member States crucially shape the process, weighing security technologies and costs, privacy and rights, and further institutional choices. We examine the views of political stakeholders in four Member States by conducting a systematic empirical and comparative study unprecedented in the existing, political-theory-inspired research. In our Q methodological experiments, political stakeholders in Finland, Romania, Spain and the UK rank-ordered a sample of statements on Smart Borders, ABC and harmonisation. The factor analysis of the results yielded three main views: the first criticising ABC as a security technology, the second welcoming the security gains of automation and the third opposing harmonised border control. While impeding harmonisation, the results offer a consensus facilitating common policy. © 2017 The Author(s).

There is a stratification of legitimacies in terms of the right to access to the European Union (EU) that favors those who escape persecution or war and delegitimizes economic migrants. After presenting the genealogy of the refugee category, it analyzes the consequences of this dichotomy for managing those who cross the maritime border of Europe. What kind of strategies, agencies and subjectivities are mobilized by a border regime that favors suffering over enterprise? And what resources do travelers use, once they are reduced to the condition of bare life, to qualify to stay via the paradox of their own disqualification? Finally, the article mentions the challenges posed by the new biometric technologies of border control and raises the question of possible affinities between the refugee and other vulnerable social figures. © 2016, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota Colombia.

It examines this question by analysing a recent initiative of the European Commission proposing the establishment of EU ‘smart borders’. The analysis draws from a set of thinking tools developed by the sociology of association in the field of science and technology studies. The contribution argues that in order to grasp policy outcomes such as smart borders, security studies would benefit from adopting a compositional outlook on agency, where action is seen as the effect of associated entities. Looking at the smartening of EU borders, the article finds that this process is held together by multiple translations and enrolments through which the technical side of dataveillance – platforms, automated gates, matching systems, and so forth – has become associated with the processes of policymaking on border security and sustains the furtherance of mass dataveillance. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","European Union; smart borders; sociology of association; surveillance; technology",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abélès, M., (1992) La Vie quotidienne au Parlement européen, , Paris: Hachette; Ackleson, J., Securing through technology? ‘Smart borders’ after September 11th (2003) Knowledge, Technology & Policy, 16 (1), pp. 56-74; Adey, P., Anderson, B., Anticipating emergencies: Technologies of preparedness and the matter of security (2012) Security Dialogue, 43 (2), pp. 99-117; Amicelle, A., Aradau, C., Jeandesboz, J., Questioning security devices: Performativity, resistance, politics (2015) Security Dialogue, 46 (4), pp. 293-306; Amoore, L., De Goede, M., Governance, risk and dataveillance in the war on terror (2005) Crime, Law & Social Change, 43 (2), pp. 149-173; Aradau, C., Security that matters: Critical infrastructure and objects of protection (2010) Security Dialogue, 41 (5), pp. 491-514; Balzacq, T., The policy tools of securitization: Information exchange, EU foreign and interior policies (2008) Journal of Common Market Studies, 46 (1), pp. 75-100; Balzacq, T., Basaran, T., Bigo, D., Guittet, E.-P., Olsson, C., Security practices (2010) The International Studies Compendium Online, , http://www.isacompendium.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781444336597_yr2015_chunk_g978144433659718_ss1-2, accessed 25 April 2016,,.

Box 90153, Tilburg, 5000 LE, Netherlands","Record numbers of migrants and refugees fleeing violence and poverty in parts of Africa and the Middle East present the European Union with unprecedented challenges, including in determining their identity as well as status. In recent years problems of identifying immigrants have been addressed in order to fight identity fraud and illegal entry of migrants. As a result, a wide variety of digital systems have been introduced to orchestrate an effective, preventative modus of identification of migrants. Digital systems are in particular geared towards spotting those migrants who (are about to) commit identity fraud or who enter the territory of EU member states illegally. Although the key aim of the digital systems is framed to protect the administrative, geographic and legal borders of the member state and the safety of its population, empirically based studies demonstrate that these systems bring new risks for migrants themselves. This article intends to contribute to the discussion on the use of digital systems for managing the movement of migrants by analysing identification and risk assessment systems from the perspective of the new European data protection regime and the European Convention on Human Rights. For this purpose, two identification systems - the so-called INS console within the Dutch immigration and border sector, and the PROGIS console within the law enforcement sector - are analysed. A third is the Advanced Passenger Information system operated at Schiphol Airport by border control and immigration services. Against the background of the position of many migrants finding themselves at risk in their home country and of the two legislative frameworks mentioned above, this article addresses two issues. First, the analysis focuses on how migrants are perceived by digital monitoring practices: are they themselves at risk, non-risk or do they pose a risk? In the EU, migrants must prove that their case is worthy of asylum status because they are 'at risk' from political unrest or other life-threatening circumstances in their home country. Yet, empirical data gathered through semi-structured interviews show that simply abiding by the standards during an enrolment process of the INS console, rather than being 'at risk', a migrant can easily be categorised as 'posing a risk' (La Fors-Owczynik & Van der Ploeg, 2015). Second, this article aims to investigate what the capacity of the new data protection regime is in protecting migrants from being framed as 'a risk' or a 'misfit' stemming from the use of digital systems. Given this second aim, the following discussion also intends to explore the extent to which the European Convention on Human Rights can provide an additional legal remedy for migrants being digitally categorised in a manner that is detrimental to them. © 2016 Karolina La Fors-Owczynik.","Biometrics; Border control; Data protection; Human rights; Identification; Immigration; Law enforcement; Migrants; Profiling; Risk","Air navigation; Biometrics; Crime; Data privacy; Identification (control systems); Law enforcement; Laws and legislation; Risks; Social aspects; Border control; Human rights; Immigration; Migrants; Profiling; Risk assessment",,,,,"European Research Council, ERC; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7: 201853","This article is based on research conducted during the DigIDeas project.

For this reason, discussions on developing the legislative framework governing these matters are highly sensitive and subject to ethical controversy. At a European level there are numerous ethical challenges related to assisted reproductive technology (ART) but none related into uniform manner to be acceptable by all member countries. Methods: In this respect, we review the current legislation of the following twenty-six European countries which are also into Shengen Area: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweeden, Switzerland, other four European countries that do not form part of the Schengen Area, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania and other two like Ireland and the United Kingdom. Results: Twenty-four of the European Union member states (i.e. Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweeden, Switzerland, Bulgaria, Croatia and United Kingdom) have reported the existence of specific legislation, while 8 countries (i.e. Cyprus, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Poland, Romania, Latvia) have reported that no specific legislation exists, only general legislation covering ART procedures. Conclusions: We propose that legal systems should supplement the existing laws and adapt it to the unique challenges presented by ART, so that society may benefit from the application of ART advancement in a socially responsible and uniform ethical manner. © 2016 Romanian Society of Ultrasonography in Obstetrics and Gynecology.","Assisted reproduction; Ethical aspects; Europe; Research","Article; assisted reproductive technology; consensus development; cryopreservation; economic aspect; Europe; health care policy; human; infertility; law; legal aspect; medical ethics; medical research; nidation; reproduction; reproductive health; sperm donor",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Edwards, R.G., Sharpe, D.J., Social values and research in human embryology (1971) Nature, 231, pp. 87-91; Harper, J.C., Garaedts, J., Boryy, P., Current issue in medically assisted reproduction and genetics in Europe: Research, clinical practice, ethics, legal issues and policy (2013) Eur J Hum Genet, 21, pp. S1-S21; Edwards, R.G., Fertilization of human eggs in vitro: Moral, ethics and the law (1974) Q Rev Biol, 49, pp. 3-26; Evans, D., Evans, M., Fertility, infertility and human embryo: Ethics, law and practice of human artificial procreation (1996) Hum Reprod Update, 2, pp. 208-224; Council of Europe, Europe and Bioethics, (1989) Proceedings of the 1st Symposium of the Council of Europe on Bioethics, , Strasbourg 5-7 December, Council of Europe, Strasbourg, France; Schenker, J.G., FIGO committee for the study of ethical aspects of human reproduction: FIGO committee guidelines (1996) Int J Gynecol Obstet, 53, pp. 297-302; Cohen, J., The French Bioethic Law, July 29, 1994 (1995) J Assist Reprod Genet, 12, pp. 663-664; Bryld, M., The infertility clinic and the birth of the lesbian.

Our paper will explore Eurodac, a large biometric information database concerning asylum applications and irregular border crossings, as part of the emerging European Big Data Economy. Drawing on the concept of the digital border and of the surveillance assemblage (Haggerty, Kevin D., and Richard V. Ericson. 2000. The Surveillant Assemblage. British Journal of Sociology 51, no. 4: 605–22) we understand Eurodac not only as a technological border but as inflected by social, symbolic, organizational and juridical cultures, practices, and imaginaries that are beyond the literal realm of the electronic space. Our paper investigates the dynamics of big data in the context of the integration of Eurodac within the larger framework of the European Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area freedom, security and justice (EU-LISA). EU-LISA is the operational platform of three large-scale European databases with regards to foreigners and their mobility within and towards Europe, namely Eurodac, the Schengen Information System (SIS II) and the Visa Information System (VIS).

However, it is precisely the technology deployed at the borders which paradoxically pushes illegalized travelers to zones of greater exposure to “nature.” The article explores from a cultural-sociological perspective the new configurations of technology, “culture,” and “nature” that are emerging through the EU border regime. Drawing on Agamben's category of bare life, it claims that illegalized travelers are displaced into a sphere of mere biological survival. A content and discourse analysis of the narratives attached to technological products developed for border surveillance and control reveals a symbolical construction of the illegalized traveler as contiguous to “nature” while technology is depicted as if deprived of agency. Technology and nature are often perceived as neutral, ahistorical, and value-free, but are always socially and historically constructed. This construction expresses a certain understanding of the border scenario and an underlying definition of what is “human.” The paradox between the humanitarian and the securitization paradigms is thus only apparent: both rely on the construction of the illegalized travelers as bare life. A global biopolitical schism along the boundary between “nature” and “culture”—analogous to what Latour called the “great divide” between “moderns” and “others”—is being reproduced but also disputed and negotiated along the EU borders. © 2016 Association for Borderlands Studies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agamben, G., (1998) Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life, , Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press; Agamben, G., (2004) The Open.

This intensification in irregular migration has led to the design and application of a migration control policy whose instrumental and institutional structures are becoming increasingly complex. Irregular immigration at maritime borders has been addressed through what we have referred to and characterized as a multi-layered deterrence strategy which has been gradually implemented and upgraded along the main entry points and migration corridors. The Spanish strategy is tightly intertwined with the unfolding of the EU Integrated Border Management approach and combines higher inputs of surveillance and border control technologies with multilateral cooperation agreements reached with transit and origin countries. High-tech border surveillance increases interception probabilities, but effective migration deterrence is conditioned by high expulsion rates once the border has been crossed. It is in the task of border implementation that technology appears as one of the pillars of the control structure and where its effect on deterrence depends on its embeddedness in a mix of instruments and actions. © 2016 Association for Borderlands Studies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, J.B., Dynamics of Economic Development Gaps: Comparing the U.S.-Mexico and Spain-Morocco Borders (2012) 2 Borders Fronteras, pp. 119-129. , Román J.M., Shirk D.A., (eds), San Diego, CA: Trans-Border Institute and Fundación Ciudadanía y Valores; Anderson, M., (1996) Frontiers.

In response to these growing anxieties the external border of Schengen space of free movement of people was established to limit uncontrolled immigration to the European Union. Yet, looking closely at how this border works in Lampedusa and its surrounding seawaters, one realizes the functioning of the European external border works to undermine the legitimacy of institutions on the island, de facto challenging law enforcement both on the island as well as at sea. Based on the data collected during the six-months-long fieldwork that I conducted on the island, this paper disentangles the complex machinery of the border as it structures in Lampedusa, and presents how such complex governing technology works through authorities' strategic use of local land and seawaters and their simultaneous neglect for the concerns of the population inhabiting them - representing a major source of insecurity for islanders. © 2016 Association for the Study of Ethnicity and Nationalism.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agamben, G., (2003) Lo stato di eccezione, , Milano: Bollati Boringhieri; Ambrosini, M., Immigration in Italy: Between Economic Acceptance and Political Rejection (2011) Journal of International Migration and Integration, 14 (1), pp. 175-194; Andrijasevic, R., From Exception to Excess: Detention and Deportations across the Mediterranean Space (2010) The Deportation Regime: Sovereignty, Space, and the Freedom of Movement, , Nicholas De Genova and Nathalie Peutz.

In contrast to claims of waning state sovereignty, drawing on detailed case studies from the United States and European Union, we argue the militarisation of borders represents a re-articulation and expansion of state sovereignty into new spaces and arenas. We argue that the nexus of military-security contractors, dramatically increased security budgets, and the discourse of threats from terrorism and immigration is resulting in a profound shift in border security. The construction of barriers, deployment of more personnel and the investment in a wide range of military and security technologies from drones to smart border technologies that attempt to monitor, identify and prevent unauthorised movements are emblematic of this shift. We link this increasing militarisation to dehumanisation of migrant others and to the increasing mortality in border spaces. By documenting this trend and identifying a range of different practices that are included under the rubric of militarisation, this paper is both a call for nuanced interpretation and more sustained investigation of the expansion of the military into the policing of borders. © 2016 Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers).","Borders; European Union; Militarisation; Political geography; USA","border region; European Union; military government; political geography; regional security; sovereignty; Europe; United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adey, P., Facing airport security: affect, biopolitics, and the preemptive securitisation of the mobile body (2009) Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 27, pp. 274-295; Agnew, J.A., (2009) Globalization and sovereignty, , Rowman & Littlefield, Lanham MD; Allen, J., Three spaces of power: territory, networks, plus a topological twist in the tale of domination and authority (2009) Journal of Power, 2, pp. 197-212; Amoore, L., Data derivatives: on the emergence of a security risk calculus for our times (2011) Theory, Culture & Society, 28, pp. 24-43; Amoore, L., (2013) The politics of possibility: risk and security beyond probability, , Duke University Press, Durham NC; Anderson, K., JTF-North deploys soldiers to support border patrol in N.M., Ariz (2012) United States Army News, , http://www.army.mil/article/76607/, 27 March Accessed 2 February 2016; Andreas, P., Redrawing the line: borders and security in the twenty-first century (2003) International Security, 28, pp. 78-111; Bulgaria ready to deploy 1000 troops to Turkey border over migrant pressure (2015) Novinite.com, , http://www.novinite.com/articles/170872/Bulgaria+Ready+to+Deploy+1000+%3Cb%3ETroops%3C/b%3E+to+%3Cb%3ETurkey%3C/b%3E+Border+over+Migrant+Pressure#sthash.Z6CPahvG.dpuf, Anonymous 17 September Accessed 2 February 2016; Barkan, J., (2013) Corporate sovereignty, , University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis MN; Behr, T., Brattberg, E., Kallio, J., Aaltola, M., Salonius-Pasternak, C., Raspotnik, A., Salonen, M., (2013) The maritime dimension of CSDP: geostrategic maritime challenges and their implications for the European Union, , Study Directorate-General for External Policies, European Parliament, Strasbourg; Bialasiewicz, L., Off-shoring and out-sourcing the borders of EUrope: Libya and EU border work in the Mediterranean (2012) Geopolitics, 17, pp. 843-866; Bigo, D., Freedom and speed in enlarged borderzones (2011) The contested politics of mobility: borderzones and irregularity, pp. 31-50. , in Squire V ed Routledge, New York NY -; Bigo, D., The (in)securitization practices of the three universes of EU border control: Military/Navy - border guards/police - database analysts (2014) Security Dialogue, 45, pp. 209-225; (2014) Fatal journeys: tracking lives lost during migration, , Brian T and Laczko F eds International Organization for Migration, Geneva; Bridge, G., Territory, now in 3D!

Against claims that smart borders offer a more scientific and ""postracial"" mode of border control, the essay offers a situated conceptual reflection on how race is currently being (re)shaped by the complex intersection of biopolitical and algorithmic forms of governmentality as they converge in border technologies. The essay proposes to think through four different sets of smart border technologies that enact and track race as a biopolitical assemblage in particular ways, analyzing the associated perceptual codes each puts into play (biometric, movement sensing, drone, and databased). It closes by reflecting on how these algorithmic technologies inflect the biopolitical targeting of race and mobility in ways that serve to insulate smart border practices from democratic accoun tability.","Algorithmic governmentality; Assemblage; Biopolitics; Border technologies; Race; Smart borders",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Visser, J., Canada, U.S. Unveil New Border Deals (2011), http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada-u-s-unveil-new-border-deals-1.736799, CTVNews. ca, 7 December, accessed 20 January 2015; Potzsch, H., The Emergence of iBorder: Bordering Bodies, Networks, and Machines (2015) Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 33 (1), pp. 101-118; Mbembe, A., Necropolitics (2003), 15 (1), pp. 11-40. , trans.

This article takes a close look at one way in which officials try to overcome such conflicts: through technology. In West Africa, the secure ‘Seahorse’ network hardwires border cooperation into a satellite system connecting African and European forces. In Spain’s North African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, advanced border fencing has joined up actors around a supposedly impenetrable divide. And on the EU level, the ‘European external border surveillance system’, or Eurosur, papers over power struggles between agencies and states through ‘decentralized’ information-sharing – even as the system’s physical features (nodes, coordination centres, interfaces) deepen competition between them. The article shows how such technologies, rather than ‘halting migration’, have above all acted as catalysts for new social relations among disparate sectors, creating areas for collaboration and competition, compliance and conflict. With these dynamics in mind, the conclusion sketches an ‘ecological’ perspective on the materialities of border control – infrastructure, interfaces, vehicles – while calling for more research on their contradictory and often counterproductive consequences. © 2015, The Author(s) 2015.","Actor-network theory; border control; illegality; irregular migration; materiality",,,,,,"2014-15; Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/G01793X//1","This work was supported by an AXA Research Fund Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at LSE (2014-15), and by an earlier UK Economic and Social Research Council PhD Studentship (award number ES/G01793X//1).

This agenda has been particularly instrumental in cultivating migration anxieties and framing the problem of threat as an imperative to identify those who are dangerous to public safety. As well founded as that may be, it masks the pivotal role ICTs have in the supervision and administration of industries and markets. ICTs, including biometrics, are essential to supervise all four freedoms of movement in European market integration, i.e., of goods, services, capital and persons. They are essential to the EU-US trade and investment relationship which is increasingly underpinned by cross-border data flows, and the most significant such relationship globally. Drawing on mobilities research, this chapter explores how the mobilities of materials, commodities, markets and labour are simultaneously constrained and facilitated in transnational development, including the obligation in Europe to protect the fifth freedom of movement, that of data. While a recent European regulation aims to better protect personal data in these flows, the narratives of threat and emergency call for immediate action, whereby any data that can be intercepted can also be gathered for investigative purposes on the basis of exceptional circumstance. The securitization agenda finds its practical utility in the hands of executive powers who are largely avoiding the legislature and the judiciary. There is no evidence that authorities catch terrorists and criminals because of advanced ICTs and biometry in border control and data intercept. The practical utility lies in the ability to target and investigate any individual and a whole range of political opposition and activism which has very little if anything to do with threat and emergency. Publics have no meaningful defence apart from self-censorship. They have no meaningful way of objecting to exceptional circumstances in which illiberal practices are legitimized, and neither does the legislature and the judiciary unless the checks on executive powers are adequately reined in. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Biometry; Data protection; Data-driven markets; Economic growth; Economic leadership; Executive power; Fifth freedom; Free movement of data; freedom of expression; Securitization; Surveillance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Peter, A., (2010) Mobility, , London: Routledge; Agamben, G., (2005) State of Exception, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Amoore, L., Biometric borders: Governing mobilities in the war on terror (2006) Political Geography, 25 (3), pp. 336-351; Apap, J., Carrera, S., (2003) Maintaining Security within Borders: Towards a Permanent State of Emergency in the EU?

This has become a prerequisite for remaining politically relevant. Restructuring the security architecture and providing for integrated security management should thus become a key task for North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union. Transformation requires from the armed forces openness to new technologies, concepts and procedures and close cooperation with industry. Transformational armed forces make traditional armed forces obsolete as they are better deployable, more agile and adaptable to the dynamic developments in theatre. The process of future-orientated, long-term transition is meant when we speak of the ‘transformation’ of the armed forces. It aims at integrating the military into an overall concept of government and multinational actions through modernization and structural adjustment. Defense agencies and armed forces are redefining themselves by investing in information technology to create a closely integrated, tightly synchronized force. © 2006 Gunther Hauser and Franz Kernic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Apap, J., (2004) Problems and Solutions for New Member States in Implementing the JHA Acquis, , CEPS Working Document No. 212/October 2004; Baldus, M., (2000) Polizeirecht des Bundes mit zwischen- und iiberstaatlichen Rechtsquellen, , C.F.

Lyon argues that modern surveillance always categorises people entailing social effects, what he conceptualises as social sorting. This paper assesses if patterns of social sorting can be found in the EU surveillance systems for migration Schengen Information System (SIS), Visa Information System (VIS) and EUROpean DACtylographic comparison system (EURODAC), which are planned to be merged in order to ensure maximum efficiency in surveillance. To do so, the paper analyses relevant documents referring to SIS, VIS and EURODAC. These systems have assumed the traditional border function of deciding on societal inclusion and exclusion. I argue that, to some extent, socio-digital borders are drawn along the categories established through social sorting. The paper exemplifies how social sorting relying on big data may be a disempowering surveillance practice. © 2016, Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society.

The field has also made great strides into many different areas of psychology including developmental, clinical and organizational. The 10 years following the publication of the first edition of this Handbook has seen highly regarded psychological journals regularly publishing topics central to acculturation. Some journals in their desire to stimulate research have come out with topical issues on migration (see, e.g., Child development, 2012). As Van de Vijver et al. (Chapter 6, this volume) point out, we are witnessing an exponential increase in acculturation studies. Compared to the about 1,500 studies registered in PsycINFO during the first 100 years of acculturation psychology research, over 7,000 records could be identified following a cursory search in PsycINFO for the period from 2000 to the time of this writing. Why this increase? We tried to answer this question in the introduction to this volume (Chapter 1), where we pointed out that intercultural contacts are on the rise for several reasons. These included (1) easier and faster means for people to travel over wider distances together with bilateral agreements between nations, such as the Schengen agreement, making traveling easier, albeit amid tighter security checks; (2) developments in information technology that have brought people into contact, who until recently were very much isolated from each other; (3) the unabated but sad and traumatic man-made disasters of uprooting and relocating thousands of people because of ethnic, political and religious conflicts together with natural catastrophes that force people to flee to different regions of the world; (4) economic developments and economic meltdowns are still with us, forcing people to relocate either internally or internationally to seek greener pastures elsewhere. All these phenomena are major sources of intercultural contact, and of acculturation; hence they are of great interest to acculturation psychology. To be able to face and tackle the challenges these phenomena pose, acculturation psychology should regularly review and revise its assumptions and theories with supporting empirical research. And it is this goal that we hope this Handbook achieves. Another goal with the first edition of the Handbook was to move away from acculturation theories that have developed predominantly in one sociocultural context, such as the United States (see, e.g., Chun, Organizta & Marin, 2002; Leong, 2014). © Cambridge University Press 2016.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Berry, J.W., Acculturation as varieties of adaptation (1980) Acculturation: Theory, Models and Some New Findings, pp. 9-25. , A.

Eurodac, an information, communication and control technology operates by means of a European database, in which the fingerprints of asylum seekers and irregular migrants are stored. Eurodac works as a so-called Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) and is applied within the areas where the rules of the Dublin II regulation are applicable. By using the Eurodac database to reconstruct the one and only responsible Member State per asylum application Dublin II regulates the mobility of non-EU-citizens without a valid visa within the EU. We understand the present paper as an ethnographic contribution to the understanding of the socio-technological emergence of the digital border and the digitization of border conflicts. With recourse to Bruno Latour’s concepts of “blackboxing” and “immutable mobiles” we develop an analysis that allows us to describe some exemplary actor-networks of Eurodac following our multi-sited fieldwork. In this connection, we have localized the current crisis of the Schengen border regime at three different but interconnected spots: From Athens via Igoumenitsa to Bari and from there back and forth into European control centers. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Digital border; Digital deportability; Embodied identity of migration; EurodacEurodac",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Amoore, L., Biometric borders: Governing mobilities in the war on terror (2006) Political Geography, 25, pp. 336-351; Amoore, L., Marmura, S., Salter, M.B., Editorial: Smart borders and mobilities: Spaces, zones, enclosures (2008) Surveillance & Society, 5 (2), pp. 96-101; Anzaldua, G., (1987) Borderlands—Lafrontera: The New Mestiza, , San Francisco, NC: Aunt Lute; Aus, J.P., (2003) Supranational Governance in an ‘Area of Freedom, Security and Justice’: Eurodac and the Politics of Biometric Control, , (SEI Working Paper 72)., University of Oslo: ARENA; Aus, J.P., (2006) Eurodac: A Solution Looking for A Problem?

This strategy has evolved along three basic lines. Cooperation with African countries (externalization) has been key to fostering fast return procedures, whereas cooperation with the EU (communitarization through joint Frontex operations) has only been complementary to national border control initiatives driven by technological innovation (technologization). An additional aspect analysed in this chapter is the emergence of a humanitarian border in the Spanish case, a scenario in which new forms of civil mobilization in defence of the human rights of migrants have emerged reactively. Particularly at the land borders in Ceuta and Melilla, the highly visible and well-documented border control practices have raised growing concerns and public debate about the violation of fundamental rights, such as non-refoulement and asylum. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Border management; Fundamental rights; Irregular migrationIrregular migration; Migration control",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adamson, F., Crossing borders: International migration and national security (2006) International Security, 31, pp. 165-199; Agamben, G., (2005) State of Exception, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Alcalde, A., The spanish action plan for Africa (2007) Review of African Political Economy, 34 (1), pp. 194-198; Andreas, P., The escalation of U.S. Immigration control in the post-NAFTA era (1998) Political Science Quarterly, 113 (4), pp. 591-615; Andreas, P., (2000) Border Games.

We are confronted with an unprecedented degree of controversy, politicization and pace of change with regard to migration and border security issues, while other internal security concerns, such as the fight against terrorism, remain on the agenda. The chapter then turns to the possible consequences of such transformation for academic study, and proposes an analytical focus on practices and diverse sites of implementation, as opposed to the traditionally dominant concern with policy-making dynamics in Brussels. In this context, we refer to borders and bordering processes as multi-dimensional phenomena that permeate spaces within and beyond the territory of the EU. Finally, the introductory chapter elaborates on the three organizing themes of technology, externalisation and accountability, which provide a fruitful cross-cutting, perspective on the increasing empirical complexity of the EU’s Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. Finally, each individual contribution to this volume is shortly reviewed under these three respective headings to support mutual dialogue and point out further research perspectives. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Accountability; Border policy; European Union; Externalization; Internal security; Technology",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aas, K.F., Crimmigrant’bodies and bona fide travelers: Surveillance, citizenship and global governance (2011) Theoretical Criminology, 15 (3), pp. 331-346; Ajana, B., Asylum, identity management and biometric control (2013) Journal of Refugee Studies, 26 (4), pp. 576-595; (2015) The Global Refugee crisis—A Conspiracy of Neglect, , London: Amnesty International; Avramopoulos, D., A European response to migration: Showing solidarity and sharing (2015) European Commission Speech, , http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-15-5498_en.htm, Accessed August 24, 2015, from; Balzacq, T., (2009) The External Dimension of EU Justice and Home Affairs: Governance, Neighbours, Security, , Basingstoke England: Palgrave Macmillan; Balzacq, T., Carrera, S., (2006) Security versus freedom—A Challenge for Europe’s Future, , London: Ashgate Publishing; Bigo, D., New officers in the European security field (2000) Issues in Transnational Policing, pp. 67-99. , J.

Cooperation between the EU, particular member states and other space-faring actors concerning space seems to be the only option to develop real capabilities since the pooling of resources is a precondition for the success. However, available research on that subject is primary focused on its economic part or political bargains, when other issues like security and interactions between technology and international affairs are omitted. Therefore, the paper discusses the transfer of European norms and ideas regarding outer space endeavours, by placing the emphasis on interactions between space affairs, security and technology on European security. In particular, the chapter surveys sectors, methods, and spheres of the European space policy, and analyses the empirical analysis of space applications and their implications for European internal security. Thus, it offers a critical technological as well as political analysis of the satellite-based capacities that the EU is currently creating, which contrasts with political statements and widely shared assumptions about the possibility of real-time “integrated border management”. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Border; Copernicus; European space policy; EUROSUR; Keywords; Outer space; Satellite imagery; Surveillance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aas, K.F., Gundhus, H.O., Lomell, H.M., Introduction (2009) Technologies of Insecurity: The Surveillance of Everyday Life, pp. 1-18. , K.

From this point of view, it can be considered an important step in the construction of a controlled space. Drawing inspiration from the Foucauldian attention to programs and technologies, and mobilizing the Actor-Network-Theory concepts of setting and actant, the paper investigates EUROSUR main methodological operations. It highlights how the making of a controlled space is, first and foremost, a mise-en-discours going well beyond surveillance and prohibition: a continuous effort to make sense of a disparate multiplicity, encompassing both human and nonhuman elements, both controlled and controlling ones.

Changes in EU policies are not only the consequences of ‘grand moments’ of treaty and institutional changes. In order to identify and explain changes in everyday decision-making, one should complement the traditional strategic bargaining perspective on decision-making with a constructivist view on discourse or language as sources of change. With the insights of both constructivists and communication theorists, this study focuses on the identification of conditions and occurrences of deliberation in the daily running of decision-making in the EU that allow for changes facilitating the adoption of new policy instruments. In this light a study of two cases will be presented of which each has taken place in a different institutional setting. The main analysis of this study is on the drafting process of the Framework Decision on the European Evidence Warrant of 2008. The findings of this analysis will be compared to findings of another analysis. It concerns the negotiations on the Council Decision of 2008 regarding access for consultation of the Visa Information System by law enforcement authorities. Analysis of both cases learned that in certain circumstances instances of deliberation and ensuing progress towards a more reasoned understanding actually occurred. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Constructivism; EU criminal justice; EU justice and home affairs; European Evidence Warrant; Visa Information System",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bächtiger, A., Niemeyer, S., Neblo, M., Steiner, J., Steenbergen, M., Empirical blind spots and normative trade-offs in deliberative democracy (2010) Journal of Political Philosophy, 18 (1), pp. 32-63; Burley, A.M., Mattli, W., Europe before the court: A political theory of legal integration (2006) Debates on European Integration.

In analyzing these developments, this article, first, develops an analytical framework regarding the migration/security nexus through building upon Foucauldian approaches to biopolitics. This sociological stance offers a critical way to deconstruct how border control practices are formulated as strategies of containing and filtering certain group of migrants including irregular and poor migrants, asylum seekers and refugees. Second, through building upon document analysis, empirical application of this analytical background is carried out with a special focus on border control practices developed by the EU and Spain. Finally, the article highlights the ethical and political consequences of these securitization practices in relation to the human rights of migrants. © 2015 P.I.E. PETER LANG s.a.

The technology is advanced and regulatory changes are underway which will allow their use in domestic airspace. As well as the functional and economic benefits of a strong civil RPAS sector, the potential benefits for the military RPAS sector are also widely recognised. Several actors have nurtured this dual-use aspect of civil RPAS development. However, concerns have been raised about the public rejecting the technology because of their association with military applications and potentially controversial applications, for example in policing and border control. In contrast with the enthusiasm for dual-use exhibited throughout the EC consultation process, the strategy for avoiding public rejection devised in its roadmap would downplay the connection between military and non-military RPAS and focus upon less controversial applications such as search and rescue. We reflect upon this contrast in the context of the European agenda of responsible research and innovation. In doing so, we do not rely upon critique of drones per se, in their neither their civil nor military guise, but explore the extent to which current strategies for managing their public acceptability are compatible with a responsible and socially beneficial development of RPAS for civil purposes. © 2014, The Author(s).","Drones; Dual-use; Responsible research and innovation; RPAS; UAV","aircraft; airplane pilot; attitude; civil rights; conflict; dual use research; ethics; Europe; human; law enforcement; legislation and jurisprudence; machiavellianism; marketing; military phenomena; procedures; public opinion; rescue work; robotics; social behavior; social control; soldier; technology; weapon; Aircraft; Attitude; Civil Rights; Dissent and Disputes; Dual Use Research; Europe; Humans; Law Enforcement; Machiavellianism; Marketing; Military Personnel; Military Science; Pilots; Public Opinion; Rescue Work; Robotics; Social Control, Formal; Social Responsibility; Technology; Weapons",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Challenging privacy?

The integration of capital markets is seen as one such area of transformation. The research presented in this article studies one integration initiative that took shape around the proposed combination of a number of key European securities marketplaces through the development of a cross-border settlement system. Taking a sociotechnical approach, the research presents the positions of the key actants identified in relation to key controversies regarding the development of the settlement system and shows how the relations between the controversies and the positions of the actants involved in them evolve. By examining the role of ICTs in the evolution of these relations, the study seeks to illuminate the complex causalities between the social and technical aspects of cross-border capital market integration. The article argues that in addition to enabling the interconnecting of an expanded set of transacting parties, ICTs bring important cognitive dimensions that enable the inspiration, planning, and foresight necessary for both developers and market participants to formulate their plans, strategies, and positions vis-à-vis the expanded and transformed marketplace arrangements. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","CSDs; Globalisation; Integration; Marketplace; Markets; Securities; Settlement; Technology","Financial markets; Integration; Marketing; Mobile security; Technology; CSDs; Globalisation; Marketplace; Securities; Settlement; Commerce; capital market; economic integration; globalization; information and communication technology",,,,,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC: GR/P01472/01","The research presented in this article was partially supported financially through a studentship from the UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ( EPSRC ) ( GR/P01472/01 ) and a bursary from Royal Dutch/Shell as part of the Moving Markets project at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

As a consequence, European states are restructuring their border regimes by externalizing migration management to non-EU countries beyond the border and creating new programs and policies to do so. Autonomy of Migration (AoM) offers a distinct way for thinking about border control mechanisms and goals of managing mobility. AoM does not read this off-shoring of borders through the lens of centralized and coordinated state powers, but develops an autonomous gaze that supplements these institutional readings of apparatuses of capture with a view that takes as its starting point the ways in which border architectures, institutions, and policies interact with and react to the turbulence of migrant mobilities. By engaging current EU externalization policies, this paper illustrates the shifting relationship between border control and mobility. Resumen: A pesar de las actualizaciones tecnológicas recientes de la frontera en el perímetro de la Unión Europea, la llamada ""Europa Fortaleza"", tanto como metáfora como realidad, continua sin poder controlar la migración irregular. En respuesta, los estados miembros de la Unión están restructurando sus sistemas fronterizos externalizando la gestión migratoria a países no miembros de la UE, delegando funciones de control migratorio a países fuera de la frontera europea. El enfoque de la Autonomia de la Migracion (AoM) ofrece un anáisis poco común para pensar los mecanismos de control fronterizo y sus objetivos de gestionar la movilidad humana. AoM no interpreta dicho desplazamiento de fronteras únicamente desde la óptica del poder estatal centralizado. AoM ofrece una mirada autonoma de la movilidad, complementando esas lecturas institucionales que enfatizan los aparatos de captura. Así, AoM enfatiza la turbulencia de las migraciones como parte constituyente, y no solo receptiva, de las arquitecturas, instituciones y políticas fronterizas. Este artículo sobre la externalización de las politicas fronterizas de la Union Europea ilustra la relación productiva entre control migratorio fronterizo y movilidad migratoria. © 2015 Antipode Foundation Ltd.","Autonomy; Borders; EU; Externalization; Migration; North Africa","autonomy; border region; European Union; international migration; North Africa; Sus",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alioua, M., Nouveaux et anciens espaces de circulation internationale au Maroc.

We trace how sovereign decisions are enacted as assemblages in the antecedent register of device development through the everyday decisions of scientists and engineers in the laboratory, the security experts they engage, and the material components of the device itself. Drawing on in-depth interviews, observations, and ethnographic research of the EU-funded Handhold project, we explore how assumptions about the way security technologies will and should perform at the border shape the development of a portable, integrated device to detect chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosives (CBRNE) threats at borders. In disaggregating the moments of sovereign decision-making across multiple sites and times, we question the supposed linearity of how science comes out of and feeds back into the world of border security. An interrogation of competing assumptions and understandings of security threats and needs, of competing logics of innovation and pragmatism, of the demands of differentiated temporalities in detection and identification, and of the presumed capacities, behaviours, and needs of phantasmic competitors and end-users reveals a complex, circulating and co-constitutive process of device development that laboratises the border itself. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Borders; laboratories; technology; translation",,,,,,"Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Dstl; Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/K011332/1","This work was conducted as part of the TRUST: Tracing Risk and Uncertainty in Security Technology project supported by the UK Economic and Social Research Council and the UK Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (grant number ES/K011332/1).

This agenda has three main characteristics: usefulness, planning and stratification, and points to a new European mobility governance. This paper explores the implications and consequences of this agenda, including the critical analysis of the so-called «Hotspot approach» and other measures such as the «refugee relocation system». Confirming the trends in the last few years, the main tools in the European border management and control strategy are cooperation, policing, new control and identification technologies for the newcomers, and the «border extended bureaucracies». As a consequence, the most advanced border posts are pushed towards the South and militarized. This paper discusses the underlying racist utilitarianism contained in these European policies. Thus, Mediterranean's governmentality crystallizes in a series of mechanisms generating new forms of violence, symbolic and direct. In this context, the paper explores the parallel logics of the «will to mobility» of young migrants from the Global South who, in spite of the security web established in European policies wish and try to be part of a transnational cosmopolitan imaginary.","Border; Emergency; European Union; Immigration; Mobility",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Balibar, E., (2001) Nous Citoyens d'Europe?

Ethnographic data show how, for example, the today prestigious Spanish border control model in Gibraltar did not stop the problem but rather provoked the shiftof migratory flows to more dangerous routes in the Sahara and the North of Africa. Spain's problem eventually became Italy's problem and, in turn, as routes moved East, Greece's problem: a vicious cycle manifesting the failure of European policies. The author follows the life histories of migrants he worked in the route from Senegal to Morocco who, in their respective African transits, have had to face walls, borders, new surveillance technologies and cross-border mafias. Migrants' experiences signal a progressive process: the globalization and commodification of irregular routes, emerging in parallel to migratory inhibition mechanisms.","Borders; Commodification of irregularity; Migration; Refuge; «Balloon Effect»",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Andersson, R., (2014) Illegality, Inc.: Clandestine Migration and the Business of Bordering Europe, , Berkeley: University of California Press","Andersson, R.; London School of Economics, Sweden",,,"CSIC Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas",,,,,00347981,,,,"Spanish","Rev.

It discusses the rationalities of allowing entry as they are inscribed in the Schengen visa regulations and in the regulations relating to resident permits and family reunification rights in various European countries. Specifically the paper sheds light on how market veridiction results in the disciplining of human rights in these policies. The analysis is conducted through a Foucauldian governmentality framework entailing an analysis of the problematisations of immigration through market veridiction and how these are applied today to limit immigrants’ human rights. The paper then compares these rationalities to eugenic justifications for problematising immigration in the USA from 1860s onwards. This historical comparison shows how social Darwinist notions of human worth continue to function at the level of rationalities and technologies of disciplining immigrants’ human rights. The paper concludes that market veridiction makes human rights function inside a framework of (e)quality in which human worth is calculated as ‘quality’ and not as ‘equality’, and shows how migrants’ human rights are made to function as something to be earned rather than something inherent or inalienable. © 2015 Southseries Inc., www.thirdworldquarterly.com.","class; governmentality; human rights; immigration; market veridiction; social Darwinism","European Union; governance approach; human rights; immigrant population; immigration; immigration policy; policy analysis; Europe; United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Andrijasevic, R., Walters, W., The International Organization for Migration and the International Government of Borders (2010) Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 28 (6), pp. 977-999; Bale, T., (2005) European Politics: A Comparative Introduction, , Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan; Barry, A., Osborne, T., Rose, N., (1996) Foucault and Political Reason: Liberalism, Neo-liberalism and Rationalities of Government, , London: UCL Press; Bashford, A., Internationalism, Cosmopolitanism, and Eugenics (2010) The Oxford Handbook of the History of Eugenics, pp. 154-172. , Bashford A., Levine P., (eds), Oxford: Oxford University Press; Bashford, A., Levine, P., (2010) The Oxford Handbook of the History of Eugenics, , New York: Oxford University Press; Bigo, D., Security and Immigration: Toward a Critique of the Governmentality of Unease (2002) Alternatives: Global, Local, Political, 27, pp. 63-92; Broberg, G., Roll-Hansen, N., (1996) Eugenics and the Welfare State: Sterilization Policy in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland, , East Lansing: Michigan State University Press; Burchell, G., Gordon, C., Miller, P., With two lectures by and an interview with Michel Foucault (1991) The Foucault Effect: Studies in Governmentality, , London: Harvester Wheatsheaf; Dean, M., (1991) The Constitution of Poverty: Toward a Genealogy of Liberal Governance, , London: Routledge; Dean, M., (1999) Governmentality: Power and Rule in Modern Society, , London: Sage; De Hart, B., Strik, T., Pankratz, H., Family Reunification, a Barrier or Facilitator of Integration?

Harrison St. M/C 147, Chicago, IL  60607, United States","Many US public schools, struggling with perceived issues of safety and security, have installed a host of different biometric devices - vein scanners, automated fingerprint identification systems, iris scanners, GPS-enabled identification badges, and facial recognition software. Schools turn to these devices in hopes of securing school space by sorting and tracking students, visitors, and school staff based on their pre-determined risk profiles. As such, this article proposes that tracing these new forms of school security provides insight into how the politics and practices of biometric technologies are fundamentally geographical in nature. That is, biometric devices not only verify identity according to risk assessments, they also work to manage mobility by regulating where school bodies can go, when, and for what purposes. Moreover, this article analyzes how these risk profiling tactics, widely adopted by schools across the United States, necessarily borrow from the strategies used in sites of colonial occupation. Looking at schools in this way can help us plot how biometric bordering and resultant security decisions unfold at other sites of mobility beyond state (smart) borders, highways, toll booths, and ports of entry in order to formulate new ""spaces of enclosure"" (Amoore, Marmura, & Salter, 2008) and ""dividing practices"" (Nevins, 2002), thus bringing students into ""closer proximity"" to military relations of force through these ""war-like architectures"" (Amoore, 2009). © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Algorithmic war; Biometrics; Borders; Schools; The new military urbanism","biometry; GPS; military intervention; mobility; student; United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Amoore, L., Biometric borders: governing mobilities in the war on terror (2006) Political Geography, 25 (3), pp. 336-351; Amoore, L., Algorithmic war: everyday geographies of the war on terror (2009) Antipode, 41 (1), pp. 49-69; Amoore, L., Data derivatives: on the emergence of a security risk calculus for our times (2011) Theory, Culture & Society, 28 (6), pp. 24-43; Amoore, L., Hall, A., Taking people apart: digitized dissection and the body at the border (2009) Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 27 (3), pp. 444-464; Amoore, L., Marmura, S., Salter, M., Editorial: smart borders and mobilities: spaces, zones, enclosures (2008) Surveillance & Society, 5 (2), pp. 96-101; Anderson, M., (2012) Students rise up against forced chipping, , http://americanfreepress.net/?p=7385, American Free Press, San Antonio, Texas, USA, Retrieved from; Arendt, H., (1951) The origins of totalitarianism, , Meridian Books, Cleveland, Ohio, USA; Arendt, H., (1969) On violence, , Harcourt, Brace, and World, Inc, New York, NY, USA; (2010) RFID tags helps schools keep tabs, , http://www.corp.att.com/edu/docs/k12rfid2.pdf, AT&T produced report, USA, Retrieved from; (2013) Bith biometrics and security projects, , http://bithbiometrics.com/wp/projects, Bith Biometrics report, Baltimore, MD, Retrieved October 05, 2013, from; Campbell, D., (1992) Writing security: United States foreign policy and the politics of identity, , University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA; Cargile, E., (2012) AISD hopes GPS program helps attendance, , http://kxan.com/dpp/news/local/austin/AISD-hopes-GPS-program-helps-attendance, KXAN Austin News, Austin, Texas, USA, Retrieved from; Casella, R., (2006) Selling us the fortress: The promotion of techno-security equipment for schools, , Routledge, New York, NY, USA; (2008) Approve exercising the second option to renew the agreement with Accurate Biometrics, Inc., D/B/A Art's Investigations for fingerprinting services, , Chicago Public Schools, Chicago; (2013) Cisco service ready architecture for schools design guide, , http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/solutions/Enterprise/Education/SchoolsSRA_DG/SchoolsSRA_chap6.html, Cisco report, USA, Retrieved October 07, 2013, from; Coleman, M., Immigration geopolitics beyond the Mexico-US border (2007) Antipode, 39 (1), pp. 54-76; Connolly, W., (2005) Pluralism, , Duke University Press, Durham, North Carolina, USA; Cowen, D., Siciliano, A., Schooled in/security: surplus subjects, racialized masculinity, and citizenship (2011) Accumulating insecurity: Violence and dispossession in the making of everyday life, pp. 104-121. , University of Georgia Press, Athens, Georgia, USA, S.

Design/methodology/approach – This paper draws on extensive background research and qualitative in-depth interviews conducted in 2013 for the European Union (EU) FP-7 project “FastPass – A harmonized, modular reference system for all European automatic border crossing points”. Findings – The Smart Borders proposal not only compounds the individual concerns related to the use of biometrics in border controls and automatisation thereof, but also has serious issues of its own, premier among which is the imposition of a two-tier border control system. Social implications – The paper is a catalyst for open debate on the fundamental questions of how we got to this point and where do we want to go. It questions the process by which the increased use of IT in border controls has become the norm and policy trend in Europe, and discusses where the limits could be drawn from a fundamental rights perspective. In particular, it warns against the institutionalisation of a two-tier border control system among third-country nationals. Originality/value – Little attention is given to the fundamental rights concerns raised for EU and non-EU citizens as related to biometrics and their use in ABCs, and how these issues are reproduced in the Smart Borders proposal. The paper fills this gap by taking a bottom-up approach: examining the implications of individual elements of the proposal to see their impact on the broader policy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Automated border control; Biometrics; EES; Fundamental rights; RTP; Smart Borders",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, B., (2013) Us and Them?

The first is the emerging notion of humanitarian 'migrant-centredness' found in the policies of elites and security professionals in the field of EUropean border security and migration management. The second is the use of animalised metaphors and imagery that pervade narratives of 'irregular' migrants' embodied experiences of detention across and beyond EUrope. It argues that what is at stake in this juxtaposition is more than simply a discrepancy between the 'rhetoric' of neoliberal bordering and the 'reality' of 'irregular' migrants' experiences. Such a view, which is commonly held among diverse critics of border violence, ultimately makes a problematic appeal back to the very humanitarian frame that has already been coopted by authorities associated with or even complicit in that violence. Seeking an alternative diagnosis and ground for critique beyond the 'rhetoric/reality' bind, the analysis draws on conceptual resources found in (post)biopolitical theory - particularly Jacques Derrida's concept of 'zoopolitics' - in order to identify and explore animalisation as a specific spatial technology of power. Understanding the work that the zoopolitical threshold does in shaping contemporary spaces of incarceration and producing animalised subjects offers new insights into both governmental logics of border security and the limits of humanitarian-based critiques. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Biopolitics; Borders; Humanitarianism; Migration; Security; Sovereignty",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agamben, G., We refugees (1994) Symposium, 49 (2), pp. 114-119. , Trans.

Recent literature finds that the inclusion-exclusion distinction is insufficiently equipped to do justice to the variety of classifications that is being applied. Instead, a proliferation of refined categorizations determines the outcome of visa and permit applications. This article explores the ‘administrative ecology’ in between the two extremes of inclusion and exclusion. It claims information technologies encourage the emergence of an intermediary category of ‘non-publics’ situated between the level of groups and the level of individuals. The ontological and normative status of these ‘non-publics’ will be analysed by using some key notions of Actor-Network Theory. © The Author(s) 2014.","actor-network theory; border control; migration; mobility; ontology; technology",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Amsterdamska, O., Surely you are joking, Monsieur Latour!

However, the research on these security measures has focused almost solely on their effect on liberty, human rights, and the like. Not much attention has been given to the actual effectiveness of the security remedies taken in the European Union (EU) to compensate for the abolition of border controls, despite effectiveness being an obvious source of legitimacy in the realm of security. This article takes a first step in the direction of correcting this neglect and develops the foundations for an analytical framework focusing on effectiveness and legitimacy. The framework is illustrated through a minor analysis of the legal and institutional set-up of SIS and Eurodac as examples pointing to sources of ineffectiveness in the very set-up of the databases. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","effectiveness; Eurodac; European Union; legitimacy; output; security; SIS",,,,,,"Universität Salzburg","The author would like to thank Simone Molin Friis, University of Copenhagen, for very useful and constructive comments.

Elections are won or lost based on political parties’ perceived (in)ability to secure Australian borders, especially from asylum seekers coming to Australia by boat (Manne, The Comment: Asylum seekers, 2010). Elsewhere across the Western world, border policing and regulating mobile bodies are also a priority, creating modern ‘factories of exclusion’ (Engbersen 2001) based on hi-tech mechanisms of social segregation, especially surveillance (see Broeders 2007; Koslowski 2004). With a budget over ε 320 million set for drone development (Waterfield, EU ‘spent ε 320 million on surveillance drone development’, 2014), we are witnessing ‘an emerging EU drone policy’ (Hayes et al., EURODRONES Inc, 2014;) that gradually spills across the border, to the neighbouring countries of Global South. This chapter looks at the process of re-bordering of both Global North and Global South through case studies of Australia and Serbia. It highlights the development of security and surveillance border control technologies in both countries, especially in the context of the usage of drones in border policing. The chapter’s purpose is not to offer a comparative analysis of two case studies; rather, it seeks to illuminate the issue of drone use in border policing from opposing sides of the borderland. The chapter presents preliminary findings from a research project that looks at mobility and border control in Western Balkans in the context of the European Union (EU) integration, conducted in the period August-December 2013. It also draws on the analysis of media reporting on drones in Serbia and Australia in the past 2 years, in order to explore predominant narratives around the usage of surveillance technologies in border control. This chapter argues that, although the rhetoric in the use of drones in two contexts is largely different, the military rhetoric underpins both military and non-military use of drones. Finally, the chapter begins to examine the impact of surveillance-based, drone-led border policing on mobile bodies caught in the ‘drone stare’ (Wall and Monahan). © 2016 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Australia; Border security; Frontex; Maritime surveillance; Migration control; Serbia; The fortress europe",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aas, K.F., (2005) Global surveillance and policing: Borders, security, identity, , London: Routledge; Aas, K.F., “Crimmigrant” bodies and bona fide travellers: Surveillance, citizenship and global governance (2011) Theoretical Criminology, 15 (3), pp. 331-346; (2013) Senior customs officials question opposition’s drone strategy, , http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2013/s3795312.htm, 3 July, Accessed 22 Aug 2014; (2014) New P-8 Poseidon surveillance aircraft to boost border protection, , http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-02-21/p-8-surveillance-aircraft-to-boost-border-protection/5274976, 21 February, Accessed 22 Aug 2014; (2014) Triton drone surveillance fleet to be based at Edinburgh air force base in Adelaide, , http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-03-13/drone-fleet-to-be-based-in-ade-laide-triton-edinburgh/5317262, 13 March, Accessed 10 June 2014; (2014) Ukraine crisis: European security watchdog says it will use drones to monitor Russia-Ukraine ceasefire, , http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-09-12/osce-will-use-drones-to-monitor-russia-ukraine-border/5738786, 12 September, Accessed 16 Oct 2014; (2014) Operation sovereign borders, , http://www.customs.gov.au/site/operation-sovereign-borders.asp, Accessed 24 Aug 2014; Adey, P., (2006) Surveillance and society: Technological politics and everyday life, pp. 195-208. , New York: Routledge; (2014) Border protection, , http://www.defence.gov.au/op/borderprotection/general.htm, Accessed 24 Aug 2014; Amoore, L., Marmura, S., Salter, M., Editorial: Smart borders and mobilities: Spaces, zones, enclosures (2008) Surveillance and Society, 5 (2), pp. 96-101; (2013) Analiza-tražioci azila u Srbiji i sprski azilanti u Evropi, , Beograd: APC/CZA; (2010) Prva srspka bespilotna letelica, p.

Border surveillance is one of the top priorities of the member states of the EU for several reasons: the most prominent is the fight against irregular migration and cross-border crime. Within this context, public agencies (at both the national and the European level) are investing important resources in deploying the most up-to-date technologies, in an attempt to stop undesired migrants. The deployment of drones for border policing purposes is already a reality in the USA, and also in some EU member states. Frontex has also devoted attention and resources to exploring the possibility of deploying drones in border surveillance, as they are seen as beneficial assets in the perspective of European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR). The aim of this chapter is to explore the recent developments constituted by the deployment of drone technology in border surveillance. The chapter first introduces the actors, policies and practices in the sphere of border management, specifically in the area of border surveillance (1); then it discusses the use of drone technology for border surveillance, looking not only at its potentialities but also at its current shortcomings (2); it will then move toward the regulatory framework enabling the safe deployment of drones under aviation law and on border surveillance (3) and presents the constraints represented by fundamental rights and data protection rules on drone technology and the challenges drones represent for the human rights of migrants (4), before concluding that drone technology might entail a further securitisation of border surveillance, together with a shift toward preventive border surveillance (5). © 2016 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Border surveillance; Data protection; Drones; EUROSUR; Frontex; Operation mare nostrum; Privacy; RPAS; Schengen borders code; UAVs",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Balzacq, T., The policy tools and securitization: Information exchange, EU foreign and interior policies (2008) Journal of Common Market Studies, 46 (1), pp. 75-100; Balzan, J., (2013) NGOs welcome Italy’s decision to accept migrants, , http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/28946/ngos-welcome-italy-s-decision-to-accept-migrants-20130807#.U38X5Ch_TKA, 7 August, Accessed 10 Sept 2014, from Malta Today; Balzan, J., Dalli, M., (2013) Manuel Mallia: Blocking Salamis is ‘point of principle’ for Maltese government, , http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/28925/home-affairs-minister-press-conference-20130806#.U38Q1Ch_TKA, 6 August, Accessed 10 Sept 2014, from Malta Today; Besters, M., Brom, F., “Greedy” information technology: The digitalization of the European Policy (2010) European Journal of Migration and Law, 12 (4), pp. 455-470; Beugels, E., (2011) UAVs for European Border Surveillance.

It is a composite term, derived from the Greek words syn (συν)#orio (óριοborder, frontier, limit, boundary)logia (λογíα, from, λóγος scientific discourse). This term may comprise the theoretical and practical research into all kinds of boundaries (physical, mathematical, social, cultural etc.). Establishing an integrated environmental monitoring system for any cross-border infrastructure is clearly a difficult problem. This paper aims to explore the risks and difficulties involved in such projects from the point of view of Synoriology, indicating that the establishment of major technological components involves certain mathematical approaches. One key question is controlling and securing environmental stability during and after the construction of a technical project, both spatially and functionally. Other issues may also be examined, such as landuse planning around a site’s area, emergency response measures etc. This work takes into account results of various European Union-funded programs on cross-border infrastructure, as well as the author’s own research on these issues. It gradually becomes clear that statistical approaches should constitute only the basic steps towards integrated monitoring and management systems. New avenues now open in the field of environment and energy. There is a need for education and training about infrastructures, materials, monitoring systems etc. These new avenues certainly require sound and peaceful planning procedures, along with a spirit of mutual understanding and good will. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.",,"Energy management; Energy resources; Education and training; Emergency response measures; Environment and energies; Environmental monitoring system; Environmental stability; Integrated monitoring; Mathematical approach; Technological components; Monitoring",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bednarczyk, T.P., Schiereck, D., Walter, H.N., Cross-border acquisitions and shareholder wealth: Evidence from the energy industry in central and eastern europe (2010) J East Eur Manag Stud, 15 (2), pp. 106-127; Collins, R., Durham, R., Fayek, R., Zeid, W., Interface management in complex projects (2010) Pet Technol Q, 15 (2), pp. 27-35; Kirin, S., Sedmak, A., Nesic, L.G., Cosic, I., Project risk management in complex petrochemical system i [upravljanje rizikom projekata u kompleksnom petrohemijskom sistemu] (2012) Hemijska Industrija, 66 (1), pp. 135-148; Lama, M.P., Economic reforms and the energy sector in south asia: Scope for cross-border power trade (2000) South Asian Surv, 7 (1), pp. 3-23; Love, P., Edwards, D.J., Irani, Z., Goh, Y.M., Dynamics of rework in complex offshore hydrocarbon projects (2011) J Constr Eng Manag, 137 (12), pp. 1060-1070; Smith, S., (1999) Need for Cross-Border Harmonization of Energy Taxes in an Interdependent World.Int J Global Energy Issues, 12 (7), pp. 340-351; Watcharejyothin, M., Shrestha, R.M., Effects of cross-border power trade between laos and thailand: Energy security and environmental implications (2009) Energy Policy, 37 (5), pp. 1782-1792","Papadimitriou, F.13a Aedonon Street, Greece",,,"Springer Netherlands",,,,,,9789401795388; 9789401795371,,,"English","Environmental Security of the European Cross-Bord.

The European Commission has recently proposed a legislative package on “EU Smart Borders” composed of an Entry-Exit System (EES) and the Registered Travellers Programme (RTP). This article examines the ways in which the EU Smart Borders reframe the traditional understandings and configurations of the EU border control system and its migration management toolkit of technologies. It is argued that smart borders take us a step further in the re-framing of mobility and identity controls in the EU Schengen apparatus. EU discourses backing up these measures have not been so much centered on the insecuritization of irregular immigration. They have instead questioned the effectiveness of the existing EU border regime, and used a “de-securitization” and facilitation of the mobility discourse hiding “discrimination by default.” Smart borders aim at identifying the future potential “irregular overstayer” and generalizing the management of mobility and identity of all non-EU travelers by implementing a person-driven approach. This approach transforms the essence of border controls in Europe and reframes the EU travel documents policy by moving away from a nationality-based approach of border controls towards another based on risk and profiling. © 2015 Association for Borderlands Studies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Amoore, L., Biometric Borders: Governing Mobilities in the War on Terror (2006) Political Geography, 25 (2), pp. 336-351; Anderson, M., Bigo, D., What are EU Frontiers for and What Do They Mean (2003) Search of Europe's Borders, pp. 7-25. , Groenendijk K., Guild E., Minderhoud P., (eds), The Hague: Kluwer Law International; Basaran, T., (2011) Security, Law and Borders: At the Limits of Liberties, , Abingdon: Routledge Studies in Liberty and Security; Bell, M., Invisible Actors?

In the period of real socialism it represented a genuine development barriers and obstacles of cross-border cooperation. After both countries joined the EU (2004) and the Schengen area (2007), the importance of boundaries as barriers significantly weakened. The joint research team of Czech and Polish geographers evaluated the permeability of 100 km long sections of the border according to the criteria for which are publicly available data and GIS processing technology. Following criteria were used for the border permeability evaluation: the presence of orographic or hydrologic barriers in two levels of intensity, the number of road crossings, the number of other crossings, the availability of the inland roads, contrast of population density in the border micro-regions, the number of entrepreneurs from the neighboring country in the villages on the other side of the border, the number of solved micro-projects and the number of solved large projects. Numerical characteristics of criteria were transferred to score and the resulting values are divided into three levels of permeability, while using 1) the same weights of criteria and 2) the doubled weights of the key criteria. Cartographic presentation of the results then showed persistent difficulties with permeability especially in the central section of the Czech-Polish border. © 2015, Asociatia Geographia Technica.

Scenarios are often used to deal with uncertainty. A novel backcasting methodology has been tested in which a normative objective (e.g. adaptive water management) is backcasted within the context of exploratory scenarios that sketch four different plausible futures (Economy First, Policy Rules, Fortress Europe, and Sustainability Eventually). The main advantage of combining exploratory and normative scenarios is in the identification of robust actions: actions that are effective in the different socio-environmental contexts sketched in the exploratory scenarios. This paper has three objectives: (1) to present the methodology, focussing on its novel aspects (2) to test the methodology and evaluate its perceived success by analysing organiser and stakeholder feedback and (3) to analyse and evaluate the results, in order to study the impact of the exploratory scenarios on the backcasting results and the added value of robust actions. The methodology was successfully tested in 9 local and one regional case study in a water project water scenarios for Europe and for Neighbouring States (SCENES). Results showed that the exploratory scenarios influenced the content of the backcasts, thus making the identification of robust strategies possible. The list of robust strategies includes both technological and social/organisational strategies, highlighting the need for an integrated approach. The approach shows high potential, but as the methodology is in its infancy more research is needed, particularly in methods to facilitate and monitor information flow between exploratory scenarios and backcasts. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Backcasting; Exploratory scenarios; Participation; Policy development; Robust strategies; Water management",,,,,,"Sixth Framework Programme, FP6: 036822","This research was funded by SCENES (EC-funded FP6, Contract number 036822) and Knowledge for Climate (Theme 7).

Current European border control practices create three spaces of control: externalised borders, through readmission and return agreements which enrol third countries in border control; the EU borders themselves through the work of Frontex and the development of a whole arsenal of technology tools for controlling mobility to and from the EU; and the Schengen area, whose regulations tend to reinforce deterrence at the borders through the Smart Border System. As a result, the EU’s balancing act between irregular migration control and protection of refugees and human life clearly tips towards the former, even if it pays lip service to the latter. More options for mobility across the Mediterranean and more cooperation for growth are essential ingredients of a sustainable migration management policy on the EU’s southern borders. In addition asylum management could benefit from EU level humanitarian visas issued at countries of origin. © 2014 Istituto Affari Internazionali.","European Union; Greece; human rights; Mediterranean; migration; refugee",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bigo, D., Kelstrup, M., Williams, M.C., When Two Become One: Internal and External Securitisations in Europe (2000) International Relations Theory and the Politics of European Integration.

A formal draft of the Regulation was published in January 2012, after a draft was leaked in December 2011, and since that time considerable debate has been generated. The Regulation is intended to replace the current EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC (‘the Directive’). The European Commission intends to take the opportunity to update the rules regarding data protection as it is felt that some changes in information technology, particularly those relating to web 2.0 technologies, have outgrown the original regulatory framework. Since publication by the Commission, very many significant amendments have been proposed to the original draft, including several by the influential Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE Committee) of the European Parliament, and again in what has come to be known as ‘the compromise text’ in a note authored under the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union. Some 3,000 amendments have been suggested in all. Much of the discussion and debate centres on provisions that are not of direct concern to the issue of genetic discrimination. However, some of them are. In what follows I hope to provide a sense of the current direction of travel; to indicate how some of the ambitions of the Regulation intersect with the concern of improved protection from unfair genetic discrimination; to point to a couple of currently contested provisions relevant to the potential scope and nature of such protection; and to indicate why the changes proposed by the Commission, and the amendments subsequently suggested, fall short in an important respect from a comprehensive response to the concerns that people have expressed in relation to genetic discrimination. Unless otherwise indicated, all references are to the Commission text as amended by the proposals of the LIBEcommittee on 22 November 2013.1A key ambition of the new framework includes assuring consumer trust in the online environment as it continues to develop. It is considered a key purpose of the reform as any lack of trust ‘risks slowing down the development of innovative uses of new technologies’.2 In addition, it is considered an appropriate moment to tackle the lack of harmonisation across the EU on data protection. The nature of the current Directive is that member states must implement its requirements locally through domestic legislation. Although the requirements are themselves common, the fact that they have been implemented differently, has not led to the level of harmonisation that was originally intended. As the Regulation would be directly applicable, and would not require any local implementation, it should successfully achieve a higher degree of harmonisation across the EU. © 2015 selection of editorial material, Gerard Quinn, Aisling de Paor and Peter Blanck.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Beckwith, J., Alper, J.S., Reconsidering Genetic Antidiscrimination Legislation (1998) Journal of Law, Medicine and Ethics, 26, pp. 205-210; Billings, P.R., Kohn, M.A., de Cuevas, M., Beckwith, J., Alper, J.S., Natowicz, M.R., Discrimination as a Consequence of Genetic Testing (1992) American Journal of Human Genetics, 50 (3), pp. 476-482; (2013) Report on the Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Protection of Individuals with Regard to the Processing of Personal Data and on the Free Movement of Such Data, , www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=REPORTandreference=A7-2013-0402andformat=XMLandlanguage=EN, A7-0402/2013 (21.11.2013) PE501.927V05-00; Geller, L.N., Alper, J.S., Billings, P.R., Barash, C.I., Beckwith, J., Natowicz, M.R., Individual, Family and Societal Dimensions of Genetic Discrimination: A Case Study Analysis (1996) Science and Engineering Ethics, 2 (1), pp. 71-88; (2012) Data Protection and Exchange of Information, , 2012/0011 (COD) 11326/12 Brussels, 22 June; Taylor, M.J., Problems of Practice and Principle if Centring Law Reformon the Concept of Genetic discrimination (2004) European Journal of Health Law, 11 (4), pp. 365-380; Taylor, M.J., (2012) Genetic Data and the Law, , London: Cambridge University Press; (2000) Journal of the European Communities, , 7 December 2000, 18 December (2000/C 364/01); (2012) Country Comments from General Secretariat to Working Party, (18 July 2012)., , 18 July; (2012) Explanatory Memorandum to the proposed Data Protection Regulation, , COM; (2012) Note from the General Secretariat to the Working Group on Information Exchange and Data, , 2012/0011 (COD) 9897/2/2012 REV 2; (2012), p. 1. , Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, Brussels, 25.1; (2008), C 115/01","Taylor, M.; School of Law, United Kingdom",,,"Taylor and Francis",,,,,,9781135044619; 9780415836937,,,"English","Genetic Discrimination: Transatl.

By the time of the Lisbon Treaty negotiations, the transformational impact of information and communication technologies on policy across the board had been recognized, but the logical consequences for joined-up decision-making at all levels of government (not just the supranational) had yet to be adequately addressed. Consequently, the EU suffered from the same truncated thinking and piecemeal approach to the adoption of technologies to realize its policy goals that bedevilled national and local governments. Inevitably, part of the problem lay in the financial constraints arising from the banking crisis and subsequent recession across most of Europe. Another part arose from the lack of understanding among policy-makers and officials about how the concept of ‘border’ had shifted from a territorial focus linked to the geophysical boundaries of a state to a functionally determined conception. © 2015 José M.

The preamble to the treaty reads like pulp fiction – it raises moral panics about piracy, counterfeiting, organised crime, and border security. The agreement contains provisions on civil remedies and criminal offences, copyright law and trademark law, the regulation of the digital environment, and border measures. Memorably, Susan Sell called the international treaty “a TRIPS Double-Plus Agreement” because its obligations far exceed those of the World Trade Organization’s TRIPS Agreement 1994, and TRIPS-Plus Agreements, such as the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement 2004. The ACTA lacks the language of other international intellectual property agreements, which emphasise the need to balance the protection of intellectual property owners with the wider public interest in access to medicines, human development, and transfer of knowledge and technology. In Australia, there was much controversy both about the form and the substance of ACTA. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was a partisan supporter of ACTA. Nonetheless, there was criticism from a wide range of stakeholders about the treaty. After holding hearings and taking note of the position of the European Parliament and the controversy in the United States, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties in the Australian Parliament recommended the deferral of ratii cation of ACTA. This was striking – as representatives of all the main parties agreed on the recommendation. © Pedro Roffe and Xavier Seuba 2015.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rimmer, M.; Australian National University College of LawAustralia",,,"Cambridge University Press",,,,,,9781107707207; 9781107070127,,,"English","The ACTA and the Plurilateral Enforc.

Policing the borders and their surrounding territory means to make them perceptible, but leads also to a special border awareness that enables populism and symbolic politics. The Schengen Process, whose history since 1945 will be briefly reported, is an example. Under the Schengen Agreements (1985/1990), systematic border control between the participating states has been abolished. Thereby an European success story was written that is linked to tourism development and implies a new perspective on borders. They are no longer symbols of separation, but associated with unity and security nowadays.

How do these practices operate? How are they assembled? In the resulting assemblage, is the notion of borders - understood as state borders - still relevant for the control of individuals and populations moving across the frontiers of the EU? Drawing on empirical observations and with a specific focus on how border control is translated into different social universes, this article seeks to show that practices of control are routinely embedded in a practical sense that informs what controlling borders does and means. This practical sense is itself informed by different professional habitus and work routines involving deterrence and the use of force, interrogation and detention, surveillance of populations on the move and the profiling of (un)trusted travellers. Its strength varies in relation to its shared dimension by most of the operators, and is adjusted to the materiality of borders as well as to the local contexts in which it is deployed. It activates, or does not activate, the maximal use of various control technologies (satellites, pre-registration and interoperable exchange of data between the state and private bureaucracies, biometrics identifiers, body-scanners). For understanding practices of (in)securitization, actual work routines and the specific professional 'dispositions' are therefore more important than any discourses actors may use to justify their activities. © The Author(s) 2014.","civil society; critical theory; European Union; foreign policy; securitization; security; violence",,,,,,"European Commission; Seventh Framework Programme","The three dimensions of the management of security and its relation to borders can also be viewed through Foucauldian lenses. Yes, border controls continue to exist as a combination of three dimensions, called by some researchers an assemblage. In the first dimension, they exist as the locus of practices of sovereignty and exception. The second dimension adds a disciplinarization of the body, with the biometric identifiers organizing controls and detention centres within a liberal logic, applying security at the limits of freedom, and developing forms of statistical discriminations of population organizing a biopolitical governmentality. The third dimension of cloudy borders, seen through computerized data, emerges as as a refinement of biopolitics. Computerized surveillance technologies make it possible to gather traces, to organize dataveillance, and to fight virtual data wars. In concluding, I would like nevertheless to distantiate myself from this over generalization of a certain form of Foucaldianism, and instead stress the formative practices that are linked to the different patrimony of dispositions and the practical sense resulting from different professional socializations: these can better explain the process of (in)securitization of EU border controls. The socio-anthropology of the different social universes of border controls and their assemblage cannot be reduced to a ‘new’ characteristic of a general form of governmentality by biopolitics, which has existed at least from the 19th century onwards. Biopolitics cannot be transformed into an immanent cause or, even worse, be seen as a causal determination of today’s practices of border controls. Biopolitics is not a structure, a paradigm, or an ideal type in Foucault’s writings. What biopolitics can tell us is that a change is underway, a change that goes beyond biopolitics: this is the differentiation of the corporeal body and of the data double, and the emergence of traceability discussed by Foucault of the dissociated human being created by the computerization of the third universe. But this trend itself is not generally applicable everywhere. It works only for a specific social universe and for certain persons, not for all. An assemblage is not a system. Some dispositions are activated; others are inhibited. For example, in the field of military strategy, killing is inhibited while containment and deterrence are activated, as well as indifference to the lives of individuals around; and in the field of internal security, mass containment is inhibited but individual suspicion and disdain of legal frameworks are activated. Human skills in detection are valued as regards risk assessment, but they are restrained in the universe of dataveillance, where risk assessment works through discriminatory statistical reasoning and calculus of uncertainty. The characteristics activated by the third universe fit particularly well with the thesis put forward by Claudia Aradau and Rens van Munster (2011) concerning the prevalence of the notion of uncertainty as a form of governing, distinct from coercion and deterrence. Nevertheless, in my view, the programme at work in terms of an assemblage connecting the three universes, despite their heterogeneous translations, is what we could call Global Preventive Surveillance. By this I mean a form of timely geolocalized surveillance that envisions successful ‘smart borders’, or a GPS security, simultaneously open and secure; mobile borders, where experts and computer analysts smoothly regulate the political contradictions and paradoxes, by managing the world at a distance, even if the effective diagram of the practices of control may be strewn with rocks and shoals, disobedience and resistance, and victims of accidents ( Bigo, 2013 ). Undoubtedly, data border controls are not producing deaths as in the field of military strategy, nor are they producing arbitrary detentions and expulsions as in the field of internal security – but they are producing dataveillance, data-bans and data prevention, creating ‘local traps’ where people are forced to live in places where they do not want to live and where they can be forgotten. In the process, some populations end up being less human than others. This may help to explain the translation of control into the politics of indifference that is found in all three universes, as if the individual human beings crossing borders were less and less ‘real’, and more and more just ‘numbers’. Funding This specific research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors, but it is a follow-up of the FP7 research programme INEX and the FP6 Challenge. 1. The interviews began under the FP6 Challenge research programme, financed by the European Commission. It involved a group of researchers working on the Polish borders, on visa regulation, the practices of airline companies, and the creation of the Frontex agency. This research has been followed by the FP7 INEX that is more specialized on the technologies used at the borders, and that involved in-depth interviews conducted by myself (author), and by Julien Jeandesboz and some of my PhD and MA students, as well as by some civil servants responsible for the training of border guards and policemen who agreed to participate in the questioning. It has been continued by research undertaken for the European Parliament on ‘smart borders’. 2. On the research protocol, it was quite impossible to present and obtain a signed ethical form. All informants agreed to speak, but on the condition that they would not be identified directly or recorded. The secrecy and the fear of the hierarchy is one of the transversal characteristics of the professionals of security. It makes the use of direct quotes more difficult, except with regards to those at the highest of levels whereby employees are more public relations-oriented than operational agents or analysts, and therefore are also the least interesting in terms of practices. The terminologies in inverted commas that are given in the text to characterize the social universes are the ones from the software of text analysis tool ANTA, in which we entered the major official documents, allowed us to extract and calculate, that have been repeated the most in the different You Tube videos, and were used repeatedly in the interviews. The combination of these three techniques helped us to understand the translation of border controls in each social universe and their assemblage. 3. See: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-rIlXq5wOQ . 4. The terminology of (in)securitization practices used here refers to the sociological approach of critical security studies (Bigo, Dillon, Huysmans). In this approach, security does not diminish insecurity and we do not even have two sides generating a dynamics of co-constitution of opposites: we have only one side in a non-orientable surface (as in a Möbius strip) that we have to call (in)security, or an (in)securitization process ( Bigo, 2001 ). In this specific article, it means, for example, that border controls and their technologies do not solve the insecuritization of borders; they propagate fears of mobility in their everyday routines. 5. Of course, we know that the scale of this observation is large and that more complexity will ensue if we introduce the detailed national and local determinations as well as the types of borders (land, sea or air), but the object here is to focus on the identification of the transversal processes of (in)securitization in the EU in order to find some dispositional properties that are singular to this specific scale and context. 6. Translation is here used to signal not only a process of homogenization and of establishing equivalence, but also a topos of incommensurability and difference. Therefore the notion of assemblage works as a process of de-assembling and re-assembling these differences (see Sakai and Solomon, 2005 ). 7. EU-LISA is the EU Agency for large-scale IT systems. The agency manages EURODAC, the Visa Information System (VIS) and the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II), as well as the projects on smart borders, but not Eurosur. 8.

Border management regimes are thus part of processes of othering. In this article, we use the management of borders and populations in Europe as an empirical example to make a theoretical claim about race. We introduce the notion of the phenotypic other to argue that race is a topological object, an object that is spatially and temporally folded in distributed technologies of governance. To elaborate on these notions, we first examine a number of border management technologies through which both race and Europe are brought into being. More specifically we focus on how various such technologies aimed at monitoring the movement of individuals together with the management of populations have come to play crucial roles in Europe. Different border management regimes, we argue, do not only enact different versions of Europe but also different phenotypic others. We then shift the focus from border regimes to internal practices of governance, examining forensic DNA databanks to unravel articulations of race in the traffic between databases and societies. © The Author(s) 2013.","border management regimes; databases; phenotypic other; race",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Amoore, L., Biometric Borders: Governing Mobilities in the War on Terror (2006) Political Geography, 25 (3), pp. 336-351; Barry, A., (2001) Political Machines: Governing a Technological Society; Beynon-Davies, P., Personal Identity Management and Electronic Government: The Case of the National Identity Card in the UK (2007) Journal of Enterprise Information Management, 20 (3), pp. 244-270; (2012) The Solution Magazine; Broeders, D., The New Digital Borders of Europe EU Databases and the Surveillance of Irregular Migrants (2007) International Sociology, 22 (1), pp. 71-92; (2005) Prüm Convention, , Brussels; El-Haj, N.A., The Genetic Reinscription of Race (2007) Annual Review of Anthropology, 36 (1), p. 283; (2012) Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council Amending Regulation (EC) no 539/2001 Listing the Third Countries whose Nationals must be in Possession of Visas when Crossing the External Borders of Member States and those whose Nationals Are Exempt from that RequirementCOM/2012/0650, , http://www.ipex.eu/IPEXL-WEB/dossier/document.do?code=COM&year=2011&number=0290&extension=FIN, European Commission.

One of the many terms used to describe this phenomenon is 'Big Data'. The field of Big Data covers a large and complex range of practices and technologies from smart borders to CCTV video analysis, and from consumer profiling to self-tracking applications. The paper's aim is to explore the surveillance dynamics inherent in contemporary Big Data trends. To this end, the paper adopts two main perspectives concerned with two complementary expressions of Big Data: (1) the individual use of various techniques of self-surveillance and tracking and (2) the simultaneous trend to optimise urban infrastructures through smart information technologies. Drawing upon exploratory research conducted by the authors, the paper shows that both expressions of Big Data present a range of common surveillance dynamics on at least four levels: agency, temporality, spatiality and normativity. On these grounds, the paper highlights a series of important issues to explore in future research. © The author(s), 2014.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Albrechtslund, A., Ethics and technology design (2007) Ethics and Information Technology, 9 (1), pp. 63-72; Albrechtslund, A., Online social networking as participatory surveillance (2008) First Monday, 13 (3). , http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2142/1949, (accessed 15/11/2013; Albrechtslund, A., New media and changing perceptions of surveillance (2013) Blackwell Companion to New Media Dynamics, pp. 311-321. , eds.

The globalisation process has geographical scope, volume and density of transactions, and a direction and pace of change. Globalization has a long history, and the local and the global have almost continuously interacted. Most forward changes have been incremental, and there have also been major reversals or almost complete system-breakdowns. There are numerous drivers of globalization of different types, persons, and groups with varying motives, and anonymous drivers like technology, weather, and disease. The article devotes most attention to a review of selected patterns and trends in contemporary globalisation These are climate change; demographic trends, income inequality, and migration; security concerns, technology, and peacekeeping; competing ideologies; the global economy, equities, trade, banking reform, and tax havens; and shifting power relationships among the United States, Europe, China, Japan, and Emerging Markets. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mansbach, R.W., Ferguson, Y.H., Lampert, D.E., (1976) The Web of World Politics: Nonstate Actors In the Global System, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ; Ferguson, Y.H., Mansbach, R.W., (2012) Globalization: The Return of Borders to A Borderless World?, , NY; Smith, R.L., (2009) Premodern Trade In World History, p. 6. , London; Free Exchange: The Humble Hero (2013) Economist, p. 82. , 18 May; Langhorne, R., (2001) The Coming of Globalization, , NY; Rosenau, J.N., (2003) Distant Proximities: Dynamics Beyond Globalization, , Princeton, NJ; Harris, H.R., (2013) The Northwest Passage: Issues Related to A Changing Arctic, , PhD Dissertation, Rutgers University-Newark, August; http://esa.un.org/unup/pdf/WUP2011_Highlights.pdf, United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.

This paper unsettles this assumption by showing that state actors in the US and the EU are stretching border controls into neighbouring and distant territories. These borders, which are dependent on transnational ICT networks, are permitting state actors to re-scale border controls in a way that transcends the territorial framework of the nation-state system. These network-like borders are discussed in terms of their contribution to mobility inequality; their implications for those who have turned to concepts such as 'diaspora' as a way of escaping 'the iron grip of the nation-state on the social imagination'; and their implications for state power. © 2014 The Author(s).","borders; information communication technologies; information flows; nation-state; trans-border flows",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aas, K.F., (2005) Global Surveillance and Policing: Borders, Security, Identity, pp. 194-214. , Zureik E Salter MB, ed.

The paper brings together the current literature on political borders with a particular focus on how scholars approach the spatial and temporal dimensions of borders and border politics. The theoretical reading of the documents of the national and EU integrated border management provides a new concept of spatial and temporal dimensions of borders and border enforcement in Finland. Secondly, by studying the practices and rationales of border management in an individual EU Member State, it is possible to gain an understanding of how contemporary EU border policy and security rationales alongside which borders have shifted extra- and intra-territorially are incorporated into the work of national border agencies. It points out how the new temporal and spatial dimensions of borders are rationalized in terms of security and efficiency, something that is believed to be achieved through the measures of outsourcing, internationalization and prevention. However, despite the techno-administrative rhetoric of border authorities, the matters concerning new border management and technologies can be seen to serve hegemonic neoliberal power relations, maintaining the distinction between the worlds' rich and poor.","Border; Border management; Border policy; European Union; State","border region; European Union; globalization; international law; international relations; outsourcing; power relations; security; Finland",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ackleson, J., Constructing security on the US-Mexico border (2005) Political Geography, 24 (2), pp. 165-184; Adey, P., Facing airport security: Affect, biopolitics, and the preemptive securitisation of the mobile body (2009) Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 27 (2), pp. 274-295; Amoore, L., Biometric borders: Governing mobilities in the war on terror (2006) Political Geography, 25 (3), pp. 336-351; Amoore, L., On the line: Writing the geography of the virtual border (2011) Political Geography, 30 (2), pp. 63-63; Amoore, L., De Goede, M., Transactions after 9/11: The banal face of the preemptive strike (2008) Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, 33 (2), pp. 173-185; Amoore, L., Hall, A., Taking people apart: Digitised dissection and the body at the border (2009) Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 27 (3), pp. 444-464; Andreas, P., (2000) Border Games: Policing the U.S.-Mexico Divide, , 158 s.

Current debates on this issue have been largely restricted to a technologically determinist approach that reduces the focus to problems of data misuse and privacy, precluding other pertinent ethical and political concerns. In response, the article engages with Giorgio Agamben's elaborations on the concepts of biopolitics and exception as an alternative way of analysing the use of biometric technology in the governance of forced migrants. It begins with a critical overview of Agamben's conceptualization of biopolitics and the state of exception. It then considers the Eurodac database and the UK's asylum Application Registration Cards as examples to demonstrate how current policies of immigration control and border management are implicated in the logic of exception. It argues that illiberal practices, such as biometric profiling and fingerprinting of asylum seekers and their incarceration in detention centres, are being enforced upon certain groups in ways that render their exclusion from the official juridico-political structure as an 'inclusive exclusion'. Importantly, the function creep of biometrics is not to be understood as the turning of exception into the rule in a somewhat homogenous way, but more as a polysemic process, which involves different forms of discipline and control that are irreducible to one singular paradigm. © The Author 2013.Published by Oxford University Press.All rights reserved.","Agamben; Asylum; Biometrics; Biopolitics; ICTs; Refugees","asylum seeker; biometry; immigration policy; information and communication technology; national identity; political integration; refugee; social exclusion; United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agamben, G., (1998) Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life, , Stanford: Stanford University Press; Ajana, B., Surveillance and Biopolitics (2007) Electronic Journal of Sociology, , http://www.sociology.org/content/2007/__btihaj_surveillances.pdf; Ajana, B., Biometric Citizenship (2012) Citizenship Studies, 16 (7), pp. 851-870; Amoore, L., Biometric Borders: Governing Mobilities in the War on Terror (2006) Political Geography, 25 (3), pp. 336-351; Arendt, H., (1966) The Origins of Totalitarianism, , London: Harcourt Brace Jovanovitch; Arendt, H., (1969) On Violence, , New York: Harcourt Brace; Aus, J.P., Supranational Governance in an ""Area of Freedom, Security and Justice"":Eurodac and the Politics of Biometric Control (2003), http://www.sussex.ac.uk/sei/documents/wp72.pdf; Balibar, E., (2002) Politics and the Other Scene, , London: Verso; Bailey, R., Up Against the Wall: Bare Life and Resistance in Australian Immigration Detention (2009) Law and Critique, 20 (2), pp. 113-120; Bauman, Z., (2002) Society Under Siege, , London: Polity; Bigo, D., Globalized-in-security: the Field and the Ban-opticon (2005), http://www.wmin.ac.uk/sshl/pdf/CSDBigo170106.pdf; Bigo, D., Security, Exception, Ban and Surveillance (2006), In Lyon, D.

A growing academic literature explains the digitisation of border controls as an instance of the post-9/11 securitisation of migration policy. This paper re-examines why European states are digitising their border controls, and then explores how 'pre-emptive mobility governance' works. Although security imperatives play a role in accelerating digitisation, a securitisation framing obscures continuities with pre-9/11 practices and underplays other policy drivers. Pre-emptive mobility governance is best characterised as a digital-era version of 'remote control', and is shaped by other organisational and political rationales-first, instrumental beliefs about the efficiency gains of border technologies; second, their symbolic role in the context of the domestic politicisation of immigration. The paper then considers how ICTs are reshaping the tools of mobility governance, enabling three distinct modes of pre-emptive detection and effect. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","EU; Governance; ICT; Migration Control; Risk; Security","European Union; governance approach; immigration; migration; policy approach; political relations; security; Europe",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adey, P., (2010) Aerial Life.

Interest in border studies has increased with recent changes in geographical locations of the border or the fluctuation of the permeability of the border between some countries, such as in the European Union. Whether the nations are trying to increase traffic flow of the border or to implement stricter border control, having appropriate information of the border is crucial for effective policymaking. The objective of this research was to identify areas of high porosity, or high permeability, for pedestrians along the southern national border region in Carinthia, Austria using terrain, land use, and road data along with geocomputational methods. Two unsupervised classification methods, the fuzzy K-means clustering and the Self-Organizing Map, were applied to segment the border into homogeneous zones according to topographic and infrastructural attributes. The fuzzy Kmeans clustering method was chosen for its ability to allow for a continuous approach to classification. With this method, an object can belong, with different degrees of membership, to multiple classes, which is a more realistic reflection of the natural world than discrete clustering, where each object can only belong to one class. However, the fuzzy K-means clustering method does have disadvantages, i.e. the user must determine the number of classes and the input parameters are required to be in continuous format. The second classification method, the Self-Organizing Map, is a type of artificial neural network and was chosen for its ability to automatically determine the number of classes and handle categorical data. The Self-Organizing Map is unique because it can transform high dimensional data into low dimensional display while preserving the topology and spatial distribution of the input parameters. The results of the two classification methods suggest that the fuzzy K-means classification is more effective than the Self-Organizing Map for this situation. However, more research is needed to determine the fit of these algorithms for particular spatial data classification tasks. The results obtained from this research provide an insight into the permeability of the border region of Carinthia, Slovenia, and Italy to pedestrian traffic and can be potentially useful for decision making processes for tourism development and road transportation management in that region. Furthermore, the approach presented in this article can be applied to other national borders to identify zones permeable to pedestrian traffic. © 2013 Cartography and Geographic Information Society.","Border studies; GIS; Spatial clustering; Spatial decision support; Visual analytics","Border studies; Classification methods; Decision making process; Geographical locations; Spatial clustering; Spatial Decision Support; Unsupervised classification; Visual analytics; Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Conformal mapping; Decision making; Decision support systems; Geographic information systems; Neural networks; Research; Research and development management; Data mining; algorithm; artificial neural network; border region; classification; comparative study; decision making; fuzzy mathematics; GIS; land use; pedestrian; policy making; road transport; terrain; territorial management; tourism development; transportation planning; Austria; Carinthia; Italy; Slovenia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2010) Aims and Tasks of AEBR, , http://www.aebr.eu/en/profile/aims_tasks.php, Association of European Border Regions, Retrieved 20 Aug 2011 from; Axelson, P., Chesney, D.D., (1999) Accessible Exterior Surfaces Technical Article.

The decrease of the security deficit by the control of immigration flow consists of three endeavours: the common border control policy, the common visa policy and the common asylum policy. The aim of this paper is to analyse and evaluate the development of the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice. The development process of these systems is not more than their integration into the so-called IT Agency. This new regulatory agency was established in January 2012. It has merged the operational management tasks of the further developed version of SIS (the SIS II), VIS and EURODAC and it is flexible to add other existing and potential new systems. Hence, the added-value of the IT Agency is to be assessed, since new technologies shall be harnessed to meet the requirements of enhancing security and facilitating travel at the external borders.","facilitate travel; information power; large-scale IT systems; Schengen; security deficit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dóczi, Z.; Corvinus University of Budapest, Közraktár u. 4-6, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary",,,,,,,,12162574,,,,"English","Acta Juridica Hung.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878434229

Self-affirmation theory suggests that human expert users could be experiencing threat, causing them to act defensively and ignore the system's conflicting recommendations. Previous research has demonstrated that affirming an individual in an unrelated area reduces defensiveness and increases objectivity to conflicting information. Using an affirmation manipulation prior to a credibility assessment task, this study investigated if experts are threatened by counterattitudinal expert system recommendations. For our study, 178 credibility assessment experts from the American Polygraph Association (n = 134) and the European Union's border security agency Frontex (n = 44) interacted with a deception detection expert system to make a deception judgment that was immediately contradicted. Reducing the threat prior to making their judgments did not improve accuracy, but did improve objectivity toward the system. This study demonstrates that human experts are threatened by advanced expert systems that contradict their expertise. As more and more systems increase integration of artificial intelligence and inadvertently assail the expertise and abilities of users, threat and self-evaluative concerns will become an impediment to technology acceptance. © 2013 M.E.

The current retrofitting and technological remediation of borders suggests their transformation away from static demarcators of hard territorial boundaries toward much more sophisticated, flexible, and mobile devices of tracking, filtration, and exclusion. Borders require the labor of software developers, designers, engineers, infrastructure builders, border guards, systems experts, and many others who produce the ""smart border""; but they also depend on the labor of ""data-ready"" travelers who produce themselves at the border, as well as the underground labor of those who traffic in informal and illegalized economies across such borders. Bordering increasingly relies on technological forms of mediation that are embedded within hi-tech, military and private corporate logics, but are also resisted by electronic and physical ""hacks"" or bypassing of informational and infrastructural architectures. In this paper we consider three socio-technological assemblages of the border, and the labor which makes and unmakes them: (1) the interlocking ""cyber-mobilities"" of contemporary airports including visual technologies for baggage, cargo, and passenger inspection, as well as information technologies for passenger dataveillance, air traffic control, and human resource systems; (2) the development of the Schengen Information System database of the EU, and its implications for wider migrant rights and internal mobility within the EU, as well as radical border media that have attempted to intervene in that border space; and (3) elements of the US-Mexico ""smart border"" regime known as the Secure Border Initiative Network (2006-2011), and those who have tried to tactically evade, disrupt, or undermine the working of this border. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","bio-informatics; mobility; security; smart border; tactical media",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adey, P., Secured and sorted mobilities: Examples from the airport (2004) Surveillance and Society, 1, pp. 500-519. , http://www.surveillance-and-society.org/issue4abstracts.htm; Adey, P., Surveillance at the airport: Surveilling mobility/mobilising surveillance (2004) Environment and Planning A, 36 (8), pp. 1365-1380; Adey, P., Facing airport security: Affect, biopolitics, and the preemptive securitisation of the mobile body (2009) Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 27 (2), pp. 274-295; Adey, P., (2010) Aerial life: Spaces, mobilities, affects, , Oxford,: Wiley-Blackwell; Amoore, L., Biometric borders: Governing mobilities in the war on terror (2006) Political Geography, 25 (3), pp. 336-351; Amoore, L., Hall, A., Taking people apart: Digitised dissection and the body at the border (2009) Environment and Planning D: Society & Space, 27 (3), pp. 444-464; Andreas, P., (2000) Border games: Policing the U.S.-Mexico divide, , Ithaca,: Cornell University Press; Bigo, D., Security and immigration: Towards a critique of the governmentality of Unease (2002) Alternatives: Global, Local, Political (Supplement), 27 (1), pp. 63-93; Bird, L., Dominguez, R., Global positioning: An interview with Ricardo Dominguez (2011), http://www.furtherfield.org/features/interviews/global-positioning-interview-ricardo-dominguez; Broeders, D., The new digital borders of Europe: EU databases and the surveillance of irregular migrants (2007) International Sociology, 22 (1), pp. 71-92; Casas-Cortes, M., Cobarrubias, S., Drawing escape tunnels through borders: Cartographic research experiments by European social movements (2007) An atlas of radical cartography, pp. 50-67. , In: Mogel Lize, Bhagat Alexis, editors Los Angeles,: Journal of Aesthetics and Protest Press; Censer, M., After major program is cancelled, contractors see opportunity (2011) Washington Post, , http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/after-major-program-is-canceled-contractors-see-opportunity/2011/05/16/AF0UXF9G_story.html, May; Chisti, M., Bergeron, D., Quiet demise of the virtual fence (2011) Migration Information Source, , http://www.migrationinformation.org/USfocus/display.cfm?ID=827, February; Cowen, D., A geography of logistics: Market authority and the security of supply chains (2010) Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 100 (3), pp. 600-620; Cowen, D., Rough trade: Logistics space and the citizenship of stuff, , Forthcoming, Minneapolis,: University of Minnesota Press; Der Derian, J., (2001) Virtuous war: Mapping the military-industrial-media-entertainment network, , Boulder,: Westview Press; Elliott, A., Urry, J., (2010) Mobile lives, , New York and London,: Routledge; Gordon, I., The death of SBInet?

The rise of private involvement in border control can be seen as a subset of the migration industry, alongside, and sometimes interacting with, other subsets like facilitating or rescue services relating to migratory movement (see Introduction). At the outset, it is argued that the European borders are not static geographic phenomena, but rather borderscapes-that is, dynamic and multifaceted sites of interventions for public and private actors. These interventions can be conceptualized as processes of borderscaping, whereby the political, epistemological and physical elements of borders are dissolved, redefined and re-territorialized. The notion of borderscape contracts is suggested as a way of highlighting the role played by PSCs in these processes. Some examples of PSC borderscape contracts are examined. These include the UK Border Agency’s outsourcing of border enforcement functions to G4S, Finmeccanica’s role in the construction of Libyan border control capacities and PSC involvement in the European external border surveillance system (EUROSUR) project’s numerous advanced borders projects. It is argued that PSC’s role in externalization1 and their development of new, advanced technologies securitizes and thus transforms the day-to-day governance of the European borders. This, in turn, leads to serious questions regarding the opaqueness of borderscape budgets, lock-in effects making it difficult for public actors to reverse PSC militarization of borders and the humanitarian consequences of this for migrants. The chapter conceptualizes this development as cases of neoliber-alization2-that is, systemic shifts in the logic guiding public-private relations, which result in the inclusion of PSCs into the forums designing the European borderscapes.3 It is argued that PSC lobbyism through formal and informal forums reinforces a market dynamic where the industrial suppliers of border control technologies create a demand for their products in order to facilitate these systemic shifts. Some examples include the European Organization for Security (EOS), and the Frontex Agency’s Research and Development (R&amp;D) Unit’s cooperation with PSCs on drones for border control. Moreover, several “blurred” public/private EU forums, like the European Security Research Advisory Board (ESRAB) and the European Security Research and Innovation Forum (ESRIF), have been granted a large influence on the formulation of the European Union’s (EU) priorities on security research. One notable outcome, it is ventured, has been increased EU subsidies to PSC research into high-tech borderscapes exemplifying how PSCs are involved in the multileveled governance of the European borderscapes. The chapter suggests that the financial flows underpinning PSC bor-derscaping back to powerful financial actors, like the international banking sector, investment management firms and EU member states’ export credit agencies (ECAs). The activities of these actors, it is argued, show that the militarization of Europe’s borders is grounded not only in a desire to prevent immigration, but also in European politics of supporting military and control exports with public funds, even if this leads to increased debt in especially developing countries. The influence of PSCs and their financial supporters on the European border politics presents severe problems for the democratic transparency and humanitarian standards of European borderscapes. © 2013 Selection and editorial matter, Thomas Gammeltoft-Hansen and Ninna Nyberg Sørensen; contributors, their contributions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Boswell, C., The ‘External Dimension’ of EU Immigration and Asylum Policy (2003) International Affairs, 79 (3), pp. 619-638; Gammeltoft-Hansen, T., (2011) Access to Asylum: International Refugee Law and Globalisation of Migration Control, , Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Peck, J., Tickell, A., Neoliberalizing Space (2002) Antipode, 34 (3), pp. 380-404; Verkuil, P.R., (2007) Outsourcing Sovereignty: Why Privatization of Government Functions Threatens Democracy and What We Can Do About It, , New York: Cambridge University Press; Larner, W., Neo-liberalism: Policy, Ideology, Governmentality (2000) Studies in Political Economy, 63, p. 14; Rajararam, P.K., Grundy-Warr, C., (2007) Borderscapes: Hidden Geographies and Politics at Territory’s Edge, , Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press; Finmeccanica Group Stucture 2011, , www.finmeccanica.it/Corporate/EN/Corporate/Il_Gruppo/Struttura_del_Gruppo/index.sdo; (2011), www.g4s.com; Avant, D., (2005) The Market for Force: The Consequences of Privatizing Security, , Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Leander, A., The Market for Force and Public Security: The Destabilizing Consequences of Private Military Companies (2005) Journal of Peace Research, 42 (5), pp. 605-622; Gammeltoft-Hansen, T., (2011) Access to Asylum: International Refugee Law and Globalisation of Migration Control, pp. 165-167. , Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Buzan, B., Wæver, O., de Wilde, J., (1998) Security.

What were the substantive and institutional goals of the EU in this policy domain? What accounts for the rising level of police and judicial cooperation despite the persistence of barriers to cooperation and incentives to defect? This article first establishes the fundamental incentives and obstacles to cooperation in matters of transnational security threats in post-Westphalian Europe. It then proceeds to explore the evolution of police and judicial cooperation in Justice and Home Affairs between 1999 and 2009, to assess national contributions to police and judicial cooperation, and to consider the potential impact that the changes introduced by the Lisbon Treaty, Stockholm Programme and European Investigation Order. A final question is considered in the conclusion: Did the level and extent of police and judicial cooperation that emerged between 1999 and 2009 give rise to a community of practice that in turn fostered a nascent community of identity resilient enough to mitigate the weakest link technology of public goods production endemic to this policy domain?. © 2013, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Justice and Home Affairs; police and judicial cooperation; public goods",,,,,,,"The European effort to minimise the threat posed by transnational criminal and terrorist organisations has been supported legislatively in successive framework decisions and materially with financial support and institution building (see below).

The central concern of the article is how these technologies of extraterritorialisation, as deployed by the state, function to constitute regimes of statist visuality that produce both symbolic and physical forms of violence for their target subjects. In the course of the article, I critically examine the European Union’s EUROSUR project, Frontex and its Eurodac system and Australia’s Migration Legislation Amendment (Identification and Authentication) Act 2004 in order to stage a comparison of the various modalities of statist visuality deployed by states in their biopolitical governance of irregular migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, and to bring into critical focus the often lethal effects of these regimes of statist visuality. I conclude by presenting a form of counter-visuality to the state’s way of seeing by discussing the work of the contemporary Moroccan-French visual artist Bouchra Khalili, whose Mapping Journey Project stands as an agentic resignification and reclamation of the fraught journeys of irregular migrants through the surveilled lands of the global North. © 2015 Routledge.

As its name suggests, the concept of autonomy of migration's core thesis proposes that migratory movements yield moments of autonomy in regards to any attempt to control and regulate them. Yet, the concept of autonomy of migration has been repeatedly accused of being based on and contributing to a romanticisation of migration. After outlining two advantages the concept of autonomy of migration offers for the analysis of biometric border regimes, I demonstrate that processes of biometric rebordering increase the warranty of the two allegations, which feed this major critique. Drawing on examples relating to the Visa Information System, I show that processes of biometric rebordering alter the practical terms and material conditions for moments of autonomy of migration to such an extent that it becomes necessary to rethink not only some of the concept of autonomy of migration's central features, but the notion of autonomy itself. In the final section, I therefore point out some directions to develop the concept of autonomy of migration as an approach, which is better equipped to investigate today's struggles of migration without being prone to the critique of implicating a romanticisation of migration. © The Author(s) 2013.","Autonomy of migration; biometric rebordering; securitisation; security dispositif; situated knowledge",,,,,,"European Research Council: ERC-AG-SH2","In this article I have attributed the neglect of the technologisation of border controls and its effects on migrants’ room for manoeuvre by the existing CAM literature to a misreading of the securitisation of migration as a mere means for the disenfranchisement and economic exploitation of migrant labour. In order to overcome this economic reductionism, I have proposed to draw on Foucault’s notion of the security dispositif to conceptualise today’s border regimes. As Foucault perceives the security dispositif primarily as a dispositif of circulation, it brings out that security concerns and the promotion of freedom of movement are not in tension, but operate in tandem. It is the interplay between the two that drives the adoption of a pro-active risk management approach that in turn explains the ‘technological imperative’ characterising contemporary processes of rebordering. But the conception of contemporary border regimes as security dispositifs affords to reconsider at least two of the CAM’s propositions. Firstly, abjection and banishment have to be conceived as integral moments of governing human mobility through differential inclusion. Adopting the notion of banishment does not, however, imply a return to the paradigm of exclusion. In contrast to exclusion, banishment does not aim at the repression of mobility, but at its institutionalisation. The abject are kept in constant rotation by being subjected to the paradoxical freedom of the ban ‘to go anywhere except where one wants to go’. 111 This is important to note because it was the paradigm of exclusion that the CAM’s proponents sought to critique and replace with the notion of differential inclusion in the first place. Secondly, the CAM needs a new justification for the analytical-strategical prioritisation of migrants’ practices. It is important to retain this feature of the CAM because it efficiently allows for avoiding a control-biased analysis of technologically ever-more sophisticated borders regimes. But the CAM’s proposition, whereupon migration temporarily precedes the attempts to control and regulate it, becomes untenable in the face of the security dispositif’s risk management approach, which strives to render unknown future behaviours knowable in order to make them actionable and governable. What this pro-active risk management approach brings to the fore is that the CAM’s assumption of a temporal precedence of migration is underpinned by a reductive reading of power relations. 112 It therefore becomes requisite to rethink the concept of autonomy in such a way that it offers an alternative, more convincing justification for analytical-strategical prioritisation of migrants’ practices. This brings me to the final, albeit most crucial, modification of the CAM: the challenge to rethink the meaning of autonomy in relation to migration. To engage with this challenge is necessary in order to develop the CAM as an approach that is no longer prone to the accusation of being based on, as well as contributing to, a romanticisation of migration. It becomes urgent to engage with this challenge because the warranty of the two allegations, which fuel this major critique, increases in the context of biometric rebordering. The analysis of the impact of biometric technologies on migrants’ possibilities to appropriate mobility and rights allows me to indicate two starting points for the task to rethink autonomy as a concept. Firstly, it is important to develop a situated reading of autonomy which captures that mobility is always embodied and relational in order to bring out the diversity of migrants’ lived experiences and practices. This is a prerequisite for restoring the CAM’s capacity to critique the discriminatory effects of biometric borders. The latter implies a simultaneous intensification and concealment of the differentiation of how the border is experienced, depending on people’s subject position in terms of class, ‘race’, gender, country of origin, age and other factors. Donna Haraway’s concept of situated knowledge offers a promising starting point for such a re reading of autonomy. 113 Secondly, a rethinking of autonomy needs to answer the question of what the assertion of an autonomy of migration refers to in the face of biometric border regimes that transform migrants’ bodies into a means of mobility control. What the example of biometric rebordering brings to the fore is that governmental technologies for the regulation and control of human mobility have become so pervasive and intrusive that a rethinking of autonomy has to go beyond its Greek etymology of ‘self-legislation’. Nor is it credible any more to simply equate autonomy with some form of independency, as in the original formulation of the CAM’s core hypothesis in the pioneering work of Yann Moulier Boutang, as cited at the beginning of the article. Autonomy can no longer be thought of as an attribute or a quality inherent to migration. Just as the forms and practices of migration are shaped by, and can therefore not be separated from, the conditions under which they occur, the emergence of moments of autonomy can not be thought independently of the ever-more pervasive and intrusive governmental technologies that seek to control and regulate migration. Autonomy has to be rethought as a relational concept. Ranabir Samaddar’s proposal to read autonomy as ‘the “Other” of governmentality’ might offer a promising starting point for this task. 114 While it is beyond the scope of this article to rethink the autonomy of migration, it should be underscored that this is an endeavour that is both worthwhile and pertinent. Not only because the CAM’s reading of borders as sites of intensive political struggle over the selective denial and direct appropriation of mobility is well equipped to counter the growing de politicisation of border controls. Nor only because the CAM’s conception of borders as conflictive encounters avoids a control-biased analysis that confirms the claims that drive the technologisation of border controls. But also, and most importantly, because the insight of the renowned migration scholar Stephen Castles, whereupon potential migrants ‘do not decide to stay put just because the receiving state says they are not welcome’, is still valid in the context of technologically ever-more sophisticated border regimes. 115 In other words, the question of how moments of autonomy of migration emerge and persist becomes even more pertinent in the face of attempts to diminish migrants’ room for manoeuvre by turning their bodies into a means of mobility control.

Thierry Balzacq has introduced a useful distinction between ‘philosophical’ and ‘sociological’ approaches. The philosophical variant refers to the definition of securitisation as a performative speech act by political elites, as put forward in the pioneering work of the Copenhagen School. Thierry Balzacq, Securitization Theory: How Security Problems Emerge and Dissolve (London: Routlege, 2010).

EURODAC stores the fingerprints of apprehended border crossers and asylum seekers in order to facilitate the implementation of the Dublin II regulation, which stipulates that asylum seekers have to lodge their application in the member state through which they have entered the EU. Yet, EURODAC is also increasingly used for the re-identification of irregular migrants, thereby resembling a prime example of ‘function creep’, that is, the usage of databases for purposes beyond initially stated objectives. The VIS will soon be the largest biometric database in the world as it stores the fingerprints and facial images of the up to 20 million people who annually apply for a Schengen visa, for a period of five years.

Since multi-sited research is based on a radical constructivism, neither the object of inquiry nor the field of study are regarded as pre-given, but emerge in the research process. As ‘the object of the study is thought of as mobile and multiply situated’, the endeavour of multi-sited research lies – in this case – in tracing and tracking migrants’ encounters with border controls across and within multiple sites.

Benjamin Muller has, for instance, criticised the representation of biometric technologies as a side effect-free solution to balance the alleged tension between security and freedom of movement. The usage of biometric technologies in conjunction with the related risk management approach implicates, however, that unrestricted mobility is only available to those who make themselves completely transparent to border control authorities, as security is equated with visibility. Muller, Security, Risk , 95. Along similar lines, Didier Bigo argues that the technologisation of border controls ultimately translates freedom of movement into ever-more pervasive dataveillance. Didier Bigo, ‘Freedom and Speed in Enlarged Borderzones’, in The Contested Politics of Mobility: Borderzones and Irregularity , ed. Vicki Squire (Oxon and New York: Routledge, 2011). Moreover, numerous scholars in critical security studies have criticised that the discriminatory effects of border controls become concealed, but nevertheless persist and even intensify, in the context of biometric rebordering. I discuss this point in detail in the next section. 42. Bigo, ‘Security and Immigration’. 43.

Template refers to digital representations of particular biometric characteristics, which are generated by means of algorithms. These templates can be stored, exchanged, searched and matched by computers, which fulfil these tasks much faster and more efficiently than human beings, thereby allowing for the move from human to automated border controls. The crucial innovation lies, then, not so much in the usage of biometric characteristics for the verification of a person’s claimed identity, but in the move from analogous information (photography of people’s faces in passports or a simple ink fingerprint) to digital information.

In the end, trusted traveller programmes intensify the controls not only for those categorised as ‘high risk’, but also for the ‘trusted travellers’ themselves as a biometric passport and ‘background checks of varying range of intrusiveness’ are preconditions for the participation in such a scheme. Benjamin Muller, ‘Travelers, Borders, Dangers: Locating the Political at the Biometric Border’, in Politics at the Airport , ed. Mark B. Salter (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2008), 136–7. This dimension of trusted traveller programmes is, however, concealed by a ‘discourse of convenience’, which re-articulates the conventional liberal discourse of rights and responsibilities in a neoliberal fashion as privileges to be invested in.

These templates can be stored, exchanged, searched and matched by computers, which fulfil these tasks much faster and more efficiently than human beings, thereby allowing for the move from human to automated border controls, The crucial innovation lies, then, not so much in the usage of biometric characteristics for the verification of a person's claimed identity, but in the move from analogous information (photography of people's faces in passports or a simple ink fingerprint) to digital information; Muller, B., Security, Risk, p. 22. , See; Adey, P., Mobilities and Modulations: The Airport as a Difference Machine (2008) Politics At the Airport, pp. 153-156. , ed.

Salter, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press; Bigo, D., Freedom and Speed, , In the end, trusted traveller programmes intensify the controls not only for those categorised as 'high risk', but also for the 'trusted travellers' themselves as a biometric passport and 'background checks of varying range of intrusiveness' are preconditions for the participation in such a scheme; Muller, B., Travelers, Borders, Dangers: Locating the Political at the Biometric Border (2008) Politics At the Airport, pp. 136-137. , Mark B.

In contrast to large-scale biometric systems for migration control, these systems promise to track down terrorists and organized criminals but also entail novel risks for society. One can govern science and technology by means of privacy impact assessments (which are currently being researched).

Performativity approach means that the analysis of the material, consisting of the bulletins and reports that have been published by the Border Guard service, is not merely focused on the representation of borders but the bulletins themselves are understood as performances of border security. The paper argues that new technological innovations, together with new legislation and institutional procedures, now steering the governance of the Finnish/Schengen border, are bound up with a new culture of border management in which border security is not (just) conceptualised in terms of territorial sovereignty but in terms of international cooperation, prevention and economic profitability. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"border region; innovation; law enforcement; regional security; sovereignty; technological development",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Amoore, L., Biometric Borders: Governing Mobilities in the War on Terror (2006) Political Geography, 25 (3), pp. 336-351; Martin, L., Bombs, Bodies, and Biopolitics: Securitizing the Subject at the Airport Security Checkpoint (2010) Social & Cultural Geography, 11 (1), pp. 17-34; Ackleson, J., Constructing Security on the U.S.-Mexico Border (2005) Political Geography, 24 (2), pp. 165-184; Coleman, M., U.S. Statecraft and the U.S.-Mexico Border as Security/Economy Nexus (2005) Political Geography, 24 (2), pp. 185-209; Zaiotti, R., (2011) Cultures of Border Control: Schengen & the Evolution of European Frontiers, , Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press; Note; Amoore, Biometric Borders; Sparke, M., A Neoliberal Nexus: Economy, Security and the Biopolitics of Citizenship on the Border (2006) Political Geography, 25 (2), pp. 151-180; Vaughan-Williams, N., The UK Border Security Continuum: Virtual Biopolitics and the Simulation of the Sovereign Ban (2010) Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 28, pp. 1071-1083; Nevins, J., Dying for a Cup of Coffee?

The regime is defined by a combination of three features: (i) a harmonisation of categories among the EU/Schengen member states, (ii) a growing use of new technology in networked databases and (iii) an increasing sorting of individuals based on security concerns. Although none of these features is new, the combination gives a new impetus to the European border control regime. The article concludes that the Lisbon Treaty and the Stockholm programme consolidate and strengthen existing trends. This implies that policies on border control, asylum, immigration, judicial cooperation and police cooperation are consolidated in a broader approach to border control, and that there is a strengthening of EU foreign policy within the European border control regime. The boundaries between previously dispersed policy areas are blurred. The combination of different aspects of security and various levels of authority requires coordination of policies with substantially different goals, and goes beyond mere border control.","Border control; Databases; Global Approach to Migration; Schengen; Security; Stockholm programme; Treaty of Lisbon",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Angenendt, S., Die Zukunft der europäischen Migrationspoltik.

We could label these discourses as neo-orientalist because of their willingness to refer to the (often Muslim) migrant as a savage, uncivilized, terrorist 'other'; in the words of Sartori, as an 'anti-citizen'. This article reflects how citizenship, following a contemporary logic of orientalism, has become a set of guidelines, discourses, practices and policies for the governance of migration. Indeed, these are the guidelines through which neoliberal globalization liberalizes the free movement of citizens and 'westernized' foreign persons while deploying technologies of citizenship and border control against different subjects, regarded as eternal outsiders, or even aliens, because of their supposed incivility, threat or un-integrability. The ultimate purpose of this article is to argue that if we are to arrive at a model of citizenship beyond orientalism, there is a need to abandon the current orientation which inspires border and citizenship regimes. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","borders; citizenship; European Union; migrations; orientalism","citizenship; European Union; governance approach; guideline; immigrant population; immigration policy; legislative implementation; Orientalism; Europe",,,,,"Open University, OU; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7; European Research Council, ERC: 249379; Eusko Jaurlaritza; Ikerbasque, Basque Foundation for Science","The research leading to these results is framed in the project Oecumene: citizenship after orientalism, funded by the European Research Council under the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007–2013) / ERC grant agreement no. 249379.

The number of border management tools has substantially expanded and includes simple fences and more sophisticated optical and electro-optical sensors, information technology (IT) intrusion detection systems, biometrical and patterns sensors and systems, manned and unmanned aircrafts, as well as intelligent surveillance means. Altogether, the border management security market amounts to C22 billion in the US and C10 billion in Europe. In addition, a multitude of ‘stakeholders’ has largely expanded to include not only traditional border management actors (e.g. the DG Justice and the DG Home Affairs in the European Commission, Interpol, Europol or the Customs Cooperation Working Party), but also the European Union AntiFraud Office (OLAF), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) programme, the Joint Research Centre (JRC), the European Union Satellite Centre (EUSC), the European Defence Agency (EDA) or the European Security Research and Innovation Forum (ESRIF). Operational cooperation on border management is mostly structured around the activities of the European Patrol Network and the External Borders Agency Frontex (joint operations, Focal Points, Rapid Border Intervention Teams, risk analysis, training, technical assistance to Member States), which is the focus of the next chapter. The implementation of these measures is supported through the use of burden-sharing tools like the Schengen Facility (e.g. C400 million for Romania and Bulgaria in 2007-2009) and the External Border Fund, which amounts to C1.82 billion for the period 2007-2013, the major part of which is distributed among Member States depending on their burden regarding external border controls and visa policy. Several new legislative proposals are in the making concerning, among others, the amendment of the Schengen Borders Code, setting up an Entry Exit System (EES) and a Registered Traveller Programme (RTP), as well as the start of operations of the Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ). These developments give rise to an intricate system for the defence of the EU’s realm where the construction of the border depends on its dislocation, both political and spatial. The three clusters of border policy repertoires described in this chapter, surveillance, smart borders and integrated border management, epitomise the emerging practice the EU has engaged in. They reflect the ‘pushing-out of borders’ in two distinctive ways: through technological devices and a particular relationship with the neighbour. The latter relies on attempts to prevent the border-related threat from entering the EU’s realm by shifting increasing responsibility to contain it onto the neighbour. This move is accompanied by conditionality (e.g. the pressure towards readmission tied with the promises of visa facilitation) and the projection of the EU political and social model geared at a systemic reform of the neighbour. A quote from the EU Internal Security Strategy (ISS) reflects the rationale underpinning this logic: ‘The quality of our democracy and public confidence in the Union will depend to a large extent on our ability to guarantee security and stability in Europe and to work with our neighbours and partners to address the root causes of the internal security problems faced by the EU’ (European Council 2010b: 9). Here the externally assisted reform, most explicitly in our case integrated border management and security sector reform, turn into modern state-building.1. © 2012 Selection and editorial material, Christian Kaunert, Sarah Léonard and Patryk Pawlak.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Taylor and Francis",,,,,,9781136332777; 9780415677943,,,"English","European Homeland Security: A European Strategy in the Mak.?",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123146228

The need to ‘harmonize’ national asylum policies in the EU arose due to the lifting of internal border controls between most EU Member States through the Schengen Free Travel Accord (1985) (Kopp 2002: 51f; see also Walters 2002). So far, this harmonization has involved a number of legal instruments covering issues such as which Member State is responsible for hearing an asylum claim (according to the ‘one state only principle’), the procedures to be used in reviewing the asylum claim, and the living conditions of asylum-seekers pending a decision (Kopp 2002: 51ff). The Common European Asylum System (European Commission Home Affairs 2011) has not eliminated differences in the way Member States treat asylum-seekers and refugees. Member States are united, however, in their determination to defend the EU against unwanted immigrants and refugees. The continent has been turned into a ‘fortress’. In 2004, a European Union agency for external border security was founded: Frontex, 5 equipped with about 113 vessels, 26 helicopters, 22 fixed-wing aircrafts and modern surveillance and detection technologies to combat ‘illegal’ immigration (Leonard 2011: 16). It is responsible for coordinating the activities of the national border guards to ensure the security of the EU’s borders with non-Member States. It has been widely criticized by NGOs and the European Church Asylum Movement since its operations block asylum-seekers from claiming protection under the 1951 Refugee Convention: The militarizing of Europe’s outer borders, the practically unfulfillable [sic] conditions for legal entry and repulsive living conditions for immigrants continue to be a system abhorrent toward refugees. The attempt to find protection in our countries has cost the lives of thousands. In our society, however, reports on refugees drowning in the Mediterranean, suffocating in containers, or taking their own lives in deportation centers are met by what Hanna Arendt called ‘the curse of indifference’. © 2013 Randy K.

In addition, the access of law enforcement and judicial agencies (Europol, Eurojust) to data stored in the European information systems, such as the CIS, SIS (II), VIS or Eurodac seems to become an essential tool in the field of EU internal security policy. Without being limited by the former pillar constraints, and above all, in absence of a unified approach to data protection in the former third pillar, the main actors in this field increasingly exchange data between each other as well as with third states. The paper illustrates the existing and the planned instruments governing AFSJ data exchange as well as their compliance with data protection rules. After that it suggests some basic data protection standards which follow from the respect of Article 8 ECHR and would improve the respect of data protection rules in the field of information sharing between agencies and EU agencies and information system. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Communication, C., (2010) Ona comprehensive strategy on data protectionin the european union, 13, p. 2.3. , COM(2010) 609 final of 4 November 2010, para; De, B., Joint investigation teams: The participation of europol officials (2007) ERA Forum, 8, p. 263; De, H., European police and judicial information-sharing, cooperation: Incorporation into the community, bypassing and extension of schengen (2004) ERA Forum, 5, pp. 425-434; De, M., The difficulties of joint investigation teams and the possible role of olaf (2009) Eucrim, 94-99 (97), p. 3; De, S., The two europes of human rights: The emerging division of tasks between the council of europe and the european union in promoting human rights in europe (2008) Columbia Journal of European Law, 14, pp. 509-560; Garside, A., The political genesis and legal impact of proposals for the sis ii: What cost for data protection and security in the eu?

The European Border Surveillance System, EUROSUR, is supposed to be operational by October 2013, and will enable the Member States to share surveillance data, with the aim of improving the coordination of their responses. The initiative is driven by political motivations (reducing irregular migration into Europe), security objectives (preventing cross-border crime) and a more humanitarian aim (to reduce the death toll at sea among migrants seeking to cross the Mediterranean), with an overarching belief in surveillance technologies as the ultimate way to solve these issues. By virtually pushing the effective border of the EU further out, this future surveillance system however raises a range of legal and ethical dilemmas. This article analyzes the discourse legitimating the need for a more robust surveillance capability at the external borders of the EU, by looking at what can be qualified as the main ""drivers"", but also the main points of contention, or ""obstacles"", in the process of establishing such a system. It argues that the fundamental belief in surveillance technologies as the ultimate tool to solve the challenges at play along the external border of the EU is such that it only meets the geographical obstacles and legal and ethical dilemmas with a call for more surveillance and more information sharing.","Border control; EUROSUR; Frontex; Maritime space; Mediterranean; Migration; Non-refoulement; Search and rescue","border region; ethics; European Union; immigration policy; internal migration; political border; population migration; regional security; surveillance and enforcement; Europe",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Amicelle, A., Favarel-Garrigues, G., La lutte contre l'argent sale au prisme des libertés fondamentales: Quelles mobilisations?""

Lifting import quotas on textile products following Polish accession to the EU and the Schengen zone has resulted in a vast increase in the supply of apparel and textile products, mainly from Asian countries. According to the recommendation of the European Commission, one of the methods to remain competitive against low prices offered by China or India is to offer innovative products of considerably better quality. Unfortunately, it is estimated that only 25% of all textile enterprises innovate, most which occurring through imitation. While most Polish companies limit their expenses on R&D activities by adapting external ideas to local needs, some attempt to create competitive advantage has been made by introducing more advanced technologies.

This generated significant controversy, arising as much as anything, from the company's failure to adequately inform users of this new service and to explain how the technology works. The incident illustrates the sensitivity of facial recognition technology and the potential conflict with data privacy laws. However, facial recognition has been around for some time and is used by businesses and public organisations for a variety of purposes - primarily in relation to law enforcement, border control, photo editing and social networking. There are also indications that the technology could be used by commercial entities for marketing purposes in the future. This article considers the technology, its practical applications and the manner in which European data protection laws regulate its use. In particular, how much control should we have over our own image? What uses of this technology are, and are not, acceptable? Ultimately, does European data protection law provide an adequate framework for this technology?

One factor in determining whether or not information is about an ""identifiable"" individual is whether the data controller has any intention to make such identification; In Germany a stricter approach to the technology may be taken in the future. A draft bill on protection against severe violations of personal rights on the internet12 has been updated by the German Minister of the Interior and, although not yet public, it is supposed that it will contain regulations restricting the use of facial recognition software; We assume for these purposes that Facebook is a data controller and is subject to the jurisdiction of European data protection regulators. It has been argued that social networks cannot properly be characterised as data controllers and, therefore, are not subject to European data protection laws but the Article 29 Working Party's Opinion on the concepts of ""controller"" and ""processor"" (Working Paper 169) characterises social networks as data controllers. Again, this is a topic for another article; See, for example, the Article 29 Working Party's Opinion on the definition of consent (Working Paper 187), which stated the position that silence does not constitute consent nor do preticked boxes, default settings, or opt-out consents processes.

Therefore, the linear model of Francis Bacon and Thomas Kuhn's notion of scientific paradigms are reviewed. This review reveals that the linear model has to be advanced, and supports the adoption of Kuhnian ideas from science to technology. As IT paradigms transform business processes, a five-level concept is introduced for deriving managerial implications and guidelines. Within the case of e-customs, a European-funded project tries to ease border security and control by adopting a common standardized e-customs solution across the public sector in Europe. The rise of the IT paradigm within customs and its effect on business operations will be explained. This chapter contributes to the research in diffusion and adoption of innovation using science progress and the interplay of science and technology as dominant concepts. © 2010, IGI Global.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bacon, F., (1605) The Advancement of Learning, , Adamant Media Corporation; Baida, Z., Liu, J., Tan, Y.-H., Towards a methodology for designing e-government control procedures (2007) In Electronic Government, 4646, pp. 56-67. , Berlin/Heidelberg: Springer; Baida, Z., Rukanova, B., Wigand, R., Tan, Y.H., Heineken shows benefits of customs collaboration (2007) Supply Chain Management Review, 11 (7), pp. 11-12; Bjørn-Andersen, N., Razmerita, L.V., Henriksen, H.Z., The streamlining of cross-border taxation using IT: The Danish eExport solution (2007) E-Taxation: State & Perspectives: E-Government in the Field of Taxation: Scientific Basis, Implementation Strategies, Good Practice Examples, pp. 195-206. , In Makolm, J., & Orthofer, G.

One set of surveillance systems fortifies the borderline. Another set is creating new frontiers away from the traditional boundary. The objectives of this chapter are to provide a detailed mapping and critical assessment of this two-pronged approach. With respect to the assessment, two arguments are made. First, there are good reasons to believe the approach is not enabling the authorities to deter identified border threats. Second, the approach is contributing to a border management regime that is having an increasingly divergent impact on the mobility and life chances of different groups and populations. In conclusion, it is suggested the inefficacy of the approach is due to contradictions and blind spots embedded in policy maker's approaches to security issues. Remarks are offered as to why US and EU decision makers emphasize the role of ICTs as they seek to reconstitute their respective borders. © 2011, IGI Global.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ackleson, J., Discourses of identity and territoriality on the u.s.-mexico border (1999) Geopolitics, 4 (2), pp. 155-179; Ackleson, J., Border security technologies: Local and regional implications (2003) Review of Policy Research, 22 (2), pp. 137-155. , doi:10.1111/j.1541-1338.2005.00126.x; Ackleson, J., Directions in border security research (2005) The Social Science Journal, 40, pp. 573-581. , doi:10.1016/S0362-3319(03)00069-7; Albahari, M., (2006) Death and the Moral State: Making Borders and Sovereignty at the Southern Edges of Europe, , (Working Paper No. 136).

Regions of cultural and natural heritage are also regions of tourism interests. Bohemian-Saxon Switzerland on both sides of the Czech-German border is a region for tourists and healthseekers. For handicapped people, mainly wheelchair-bound people, it is often diffcult to identify passable ways within the nature reserves in topographic or tourism maps. The paper deals with practical aspects of geo-data utilization for creating a Tourist Information System (TIS) for barrier-free tourism in Bohemian-Saxon Switzerland. This cross-border TIS contains digital data about length, level of diffculty, slope, surface and condition of the paths, valuable information for planning, and tour suggestions for handicapped people. Some of the main objectives of the project SISTEMaPARC, which was the master project, are the cross-border compatibility of geometric and thematic data, the management and development of cross-border national park regions in Europe and the fostering an effcient regional management and sustainable development of protected regions. This TIS for barrier-free tourism is embedded into the activities of the EU-Project SISTEMaPARC.","Barrier-free tourism; Cross-border management of protected areas; Geo-information system; GIS for handicapped; National parks bohemian and saxon switzerland; Sustainability in tourism; Visualization of geo-data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bierig, R., (1996) Aufbau Eines Wanderwege-GIS Für Die Grenzüberschreitende Nationalparkregion Sächsisch-Böhmische Schweiz.

However, despite hundreds of thousands of fingerprints being processed through this system each year, Eurodac has received only very little media attention. In Europe, much of the public debate about the use of biometric technologies for the purpose of automated personal identification is centered on the gradual introduction of new biometric passports. To view biometric systems as "" black boxes "" leads to erroneous conclusions about their effectiveness, both from a technophobic and a technophile point of view. Rather, on a technical, socio-economic and historical level, they should be understood as complex systems that integrate smaller computer systems which are being sold to state and private actors by different manufacturers. The use of biometric identification systems at national borders can be seen as being part of communicative processes in the negotiation of access to resources and power. And the technology itself is a disputatious actor not least because of its unavoidable measurement errors (though categorizable) and unpredictable interactions with human actors. Thus, political responsibility for who is and who is not granted access cannot simply be devolved unto biometric systems as allegedly infallible and unambiguous technical authorities.","Automation of border crossings; Biometric border control; Biometric identification; Biometric identity; Biometrics; Identity check; Identity control; Technology assessment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Allen, R., Sankar, P., Prabhakar, S., Fingerprint identification technology (2005) Biometric Systems: Technology, Design and Performance Evaluation, pp. 21-61. , Wayman, James L. et al.

These are more than simple responses to stricter migration controls and are associated with related developments in technology and communications. They are therefore a structural change in migration systems which require a re-examination of the ways in which protection is offered to migrants. This has become an important theme of international discussion since 2005 but the humanitarian situation of international migrants on particular routes remains of concern to aid groups and many in the international community. This paper, based on research in Morocco, considers the protection needs of three groups of 'stranded' migrants: yet to be recognized refugees, previously recognized refugees and those with other protection needs. It examines migration histories to identify reasons why this third group of individuals may be unable or unwilling to return and the nature of humanitarian assistance they require. © The Author 2010.

In this new system of controls, the focus is less on the physical crossing of territorial borders and more on the process as a whole; from airline reservations, ticketing and visa applications to monitoring individuals after arriving in the country of destination. The developing mode of border control encompasses a multiplication of borders, a multiplication of actors and a multiplication of data and technology. The question arises: Does the new form of border management in Western countries bring forward the aims of border control more effectively and does it entail new risks (for visitors/migrants)? In this article I will first outline a normative framework for evaluating current developments in border control, building on studies in political theory and the philosophy of law. I then substantiate my claim that a new type of border control is developing and present an overview of three interconnected multiplications. Next, using findings from empirical and legal studies, (likely) consequences of the multiplications will be presented. Linking these consequences to the normative framework allows us, finally, to point out risks of the currently developing system of border control. Points for practitioners In recent decades Western countries have introduced new measures of border control, including new technologies and new types of agents in new roles. Together, these new measures make for a new type of global border control management. Our evaluation of this development shows that it entails new types of risks, and that these risks are likely to increase if this type of management develops further along the same lines. This analysis calls for a reorientation on instruments of border control leading to a more encompassing type of risk management in this field. © The authors, 2010.","E-government; Evaluation; Implementation; International administration; Networks","administration; government; implementation process; political border; political development; risk assessment; territorial management; Australia; Europe; North America",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Amnesty, (2005) Spain.

The twin issues ofdata protection and data security within what was the EU’s third pillar legal framework thereforecome to the fore. With the Lisbon Treaty reform of the EU, and the increased role of the Commissionin PJCCM policy areas, and the integration of the PJCCM provisions with what have traditionallybeen the pillar I activities of Frontex, the opportunity for streamlining the data protection and datasecurity provisions of the law enforcement bodies of the post-Lisbon EU arises. This is recognisedby the Commission in their drafting of an amending regulation for Frontex2, when they say thatthey would prefer “to return to the question of personal data in the context of the overall strategyfor information exchange to be presented later this year and also taking into account the reflectionto be carried out on how to further develop cooperation between agencies in the justice and homeaffairs field as requested by the Stockholm programme.”3 The focus of the literature published onthis topic, has for the most part, been on the data protection provisions in Pillar I, EC. While thefocus of research has recently sifted to the previously Pillar III PJCCM provisions on data protection,4a more focused analysis of the interlocking issues of data protection and data security needs to bemade in the context of the law enforcement bodies, particularly with regard to those which werebased in the pre-Lisbon third pillar. This paper will make a contribution to that debate, arguing thata review of both the data protection and security provision post-Lisbon is required, not only inorder to reinforce individual rights, but also inter-agency operability in combating cross-border EUcrime. The EC’s provisions on data protection, as enshrined by Directive 95/46/EC, do not apply tothe legal frameworks covering developments within the third pillar of the EU. Even CouncilFramework Decision 2008/977/JHA, which is supposed to cover data protection provisions withinPJCCM expressly states that its provisions do not apply to “Europol, Eurojust, the SchengenInformation System (SIS)” or to the Customs Information System (CIS). In addition, the post Treaty ofPrüm provisions covering the sharing of DNA profiles, dactyloscopic data and vehicle registrationdata pursuant to Council Decision 2008/615/JHA, are not to be covered by the provisions of the2008 Framework Decision. As stated by Hijmans and Scirocco, the regime is “best defined as apatchwork of data protection regimes”, with “no legal framework which is stable and unequivocal,like Directive 95/46/EC in the First pillar”.5 Data security issues are also key to the sharing of data in organised crime or counterterrorism situations. This article will critically analyse the current legalframework for data protection and security within the third pillar of the EU. © 2010, Journal of Contemporary European Research.

The changing international security environment and the emergence of asymmetric and non-conventional threats in SEE created the need for a regional approach to develop common plans and strategies through enhancing coordination among the different security agencies. This initiative fully supports current international efforts to promote CBSC in SEE, taking also into account other initiatives in the region sponsored by the UN, EU, NATO and OSCE. Since the establishment of the CBSC WG, the WG members participated in a lot of activities including a number of relevant seminars and conferences organised by SEDM nations, and they also push forward measures to improve transparency and visibility of the WG, by opening up to cooperation with other organisations and processes. The main threat today undoubtedly is CBRN terrorism. International terrorism includes spreading of WMD technology and expertise. WMD information is widely accessible and highly-trained engineers and physicists employed spreading throughout the world. Organised and general international crimes include the smuggling of WMD and related material, dual-use goods and transfers of NBC technologies, equipment, agents and knowledge.","Global proliferation threat; Practical levels of non-proliferation policy; Scientific and technical realities; Threats posed by cbrn terrorism; Treaties and agreements towards cbrn","biological weapon; border region; chemical weapon; environmental legislation; European Union; global perspective; international agreement; international relations; NATO; nuclear weapon; radioactivity; security threat; terrorism; United Nations; weaponry; Europe",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Chalaris, M., Stavrakakis, P., Sarafis, P., Assessing the threat of terrorist use of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons in the South-East European Countries J. of Environmental Protection and Ecology, , (in press); http://www.mod.gov.al/SEDM/issues-cbsc-info.htm; http://www.morm.gov.mk:8080/morrn/sedm-pmsc/sedm-cc/proj/cbsc.html; Loye, D., Coupland, R., Who will assist the victims of use of nuclear, radiological, biological or chemical weapons - and how?

Increasingly people have little control over their own information and this is the real challenge facing organisations and governments in an era of exponential creation, networking and duplication of data, most of which is identifiable in nature. Traditionally, identity management has been considered as the process of managing information for a person's interaction with an organization's information systems and assets. Nowadays, there is a key fundamental business shift away from the traditional approach in which a user's identity was managed manually on a system-by-system basis. Federated identity management, which supports multiple entities connected within a circle of trust, is one of the major initiatives growing out of Web services that will provide substantial benefits to corporations and consumers. Federated identity management (IDM) refers to the ability to establish trust relationships between various security domains to enable the passing of authentication, authorization and privacy assertions. This is a key aspect of identity management in the context of business-to-business integration, typically when Web services technology is used. The European Union is actively pursuing an interoperable pan-European e-IDM since 2006. Under this initiative, EU governments have agreed to facilitate, as a matter of high priority, the establishment for mutual recognition of national electronic identities for public administration Web sites and services. The key reason for promoting the interoperability of e-identification is the growth of demand for cross-border services, which needs to be met by equivalent crossborder framework of cooperation. Once this initiative reaches a good level of success and an acceptable maturity level, it could possibly prove the model for a worldwide interoperable e-identification system, increasing the efficiency of transactions, and significantly enhancing the effectiveness of border control systems. © 2010 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

The ambition behind the European information systems - like the Schengen Information System and Eurodac - is to establish a single Union information system to control the flux of migrants. We show that in this process information technology is not a neutral tool to reach established goals but that it is 'greedy'. This greediness indicates the distorting potential of information technology regarding the means-end logic. Our analysis suggests that the European migration policy is stuck in a 'digital fix', i.e. a technological fix focusing on ICT. We identify three political issues concerning greedy information technology within the context of the European migration policy. The first issue concerns the democratic control on information systems. The second issue discusses the weak legal position of immigrants. The third issue inquires into the effectiveness of information systems as a policy instrument. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2010.","digital borders; European migration policy; illegal immigrants; information technology; Schengen information system",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Baldaccini, A., Counter-terrorism and the EU strategy for border security: Framing suspects with biometric documents and databases (2008) European Journal of Migration and Law, 10, pp. 31-49. , at 47; Amoore, L., Biometric borders: Governing mobilities in the war on terror (2006) Political Geography, 25, pp. 336-351; Vedder, A., (2007) Van Privacyparadijs Tot Controlestaat?

This paper assesses the potential use of satellite imagery to monitor flows of people across borders. The objective of this ""border monitoring"" assessment is to contribute to the development of scenarios on potential future migration through land borders and to develop recommendations for border management. This study begins with an assessment of statistical and earth observation information datasets to monitor border crossing in real time. Due to the unavailability of relevant data, this study evolved towards an indirect definition of migrants' likelihood to cross the border (the border permeability). The permeability model combines earth observation and geo-spatial technologies with formal decision theory to assess the likelihood that a border area may be crossed by an illegal migrant, based on a presumed cost/opportunity behavioural strategy. Two preliminary permeability models were developed on two different areas, the EU-25 land border and the Central African region. The resulting permeability maps help in the overall understanding of illegal migration patterns. In the border monitoring process, they help to identify high permeability areas where change detection analysis can be carried out using medium resolution satellite imagery. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","geographical information system; Illegal migration; multi-criteria model; remote sensing; statistics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ackleson, J., Directions in border security research (2003) Social Science Journal, 40 (4), pp. 573-581. , DOI 10.1016/S0362-3319(03)00069-7, PII S0362331903000697; Bartholome, E., Belward, A.S., GLC2000: A new approach to global land cover mapping from earth observation data (2005) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 26 (9), pp. 1959-1977. , DOI 10.1080/01431160412331291297; Berg, E., Border crossing in manifest perceptions and actual needs (2000) Borders, Regions and People, pp. 151-165. , Pion, London; Berg, E., Oras, S., Writing post-Soviet Estonia on to the world map (2000) Political Geography, 19 (5), pp. 601-625. , DOI 10.1016/S0962-6298(00)00005-6, PII S0962629800000056; Blake, G., Borderlands under stress: Some global perspectives (2000) Borderlands under Stress, pp. 1-16. , M.

Similarly to its international presence, respondents appear to describe the EU’s international actorness as influenced by its atypical character as a multinational, non-state actor. While this distinctiveness was viewed as a constitutive trait of its international presence, it is now described as the key limit to a satisfactory performance at the global level. The interplay between the two dimensions (international presence and global actorness) is easily unveiled: the EU’s atypical entity as a new type of international player (which is seen as a strong element of its presence) invariably raises expectations as to what it should do; yet, its ambiguity limits its role performance fuelling harsh criticisms with regard to its actual global actorness. Paradoxically, what was seen as a key strength in defining the EU’s international presence is also regarded as its main weakness in terms of actorness. In this regard, some of the diplomats highlight how the distinction between high and low policies in EU external relations (Hoffmann 1966) contributes to delineating the EU role (JA2, SA1, ME3). Whereas some important competencies - such as international trade - are handled at the Community level, others - such as foreign policy, security and justice and home affairs - are conceived as standing firmly at the national level. The EU is generally described as an effective actor in those areas where there are clear delegated competencies at the Community level. In those areas, as we will see, the EU is seen to have a strong, undisputed role on the international scene (Figure 14.2). This is the case for international trade and technological development (IN2), but also for regulation, a sector in which the EU is said to play a powerful role, probably more so than the US (JA2, IS1, US3). However, this strong relevance is often criticized as way of maintaining a privileged economic position on the international scene. As put by a South African diplomat, the developing world tends to see the EU as protectionist bloc, which uses technical barriers in order to protect its market while promoting an official policy of tariff removals (SA1). According to an Indian diplomat, the powerful role that the EU plays in international trade affords it a disproportionate representation in the World Trade Organization (WTO), which brings into question the actual multilateral vocation of the EU itself (IN2). The EU is also blamed for not being particularly transparent in its regulatory processes (IS1, US3). Furthermore, over-regulation is not only seen as a tacit instrument of power, but also as a burden on other countries, which inevitably slows down international cooperation (AU1). © 2010 Selection and editorial matter, Sonia Lucarelli and Lorenzo Fioramonti; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Allen, D., Smith, M., Western Europe’s Presence in the Contemporary International Arena (1990) Review of International Studies, 16 (1), pp. 19-37; Bretherton, C., Vogler, J., (1999) The European Union as a Global Actor, , London: Routledge; Cohen, R., (1991) Negotiating across Cultures, , Washington, DC: United States Institute of Peace Press; Hoffmann, S., Obstinate or Obsolete?

Centre-ville, Montreal, QC H3C 3J7, Canada","In Western states, restrictive migration policies over the last 30 years have entailed a shift in the practices of control, leading to the institution of systems of detention at international borders. Border confinement raises substantial issues about fundamental rights; it involves questions of legality and legitimacy, and the definition of new technologies of government. In France, the origins of border detention show how pre-existing administrative practices of detention were legalized through the adoption of ""waiting zones,"" a new regime of detention that enhanced both conditions of detention and disciplinary control over detainees. This development confronts human-rights activists who have opposed border detention since the mid-1970s with ""paradoxical gains"" and a tough dilemma: the rights that have been granted by the state to travellers held at the borders are not enough, whereas legalization has opened the way for new control mechanisms. Understanding border confinement involves analysing these paradoxes produced by constant negotiations between the administration, willing to tighten control over its borders, and concerns of certain groups within civil society, willing to defend basic rights and give a legal framework to control practices. In France, the diffusion of penitentiary models of management and the ambiguities of law that this article explores further draw together the conditions for administrative processes of legal exclusion. What do such processes teach us about evolving regimes of government within rights-based liberal systems?","Border control; Extraterritorial confinement; Legal mobilization; Undocumented aliens and asylum seekers in the EU",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2001), Paris: La Découverte; Duffield, M., Development, Security, and Unending War: Governing the World of Peoples, , London: Polity Press 2007; Bigo, D., (1996) Police en Réseaux, L'expérience Européenne, p. 303. , Paris: Presses de Sciences Po; Balibar, Nous, Citoyens D'Europe?, p. 175; Salas, D., Incriminés, discriminés (2001) Immigration Illégale et Pratiques Judiciaires en France,"" Hommes et Migrations, 1241, p. 178; Julien-Laferrière, F., La rétention des étrangers aux frontières françaises (1996) Cultures et Conflits, 23; Lavenex, S., (2001) The Europeanisation of Refugee Policies: Between Human Rights and Internal Security, , Aldershot, UK: Ashgate; Fischer, N., Entre urgence et contrôle. les centres de rétention dans la France contemporaine (2007) Asylons, 2. , http://terra.rezo.net/article663.html; (2008) Figures from the French Ministry of Immigration, Integration, National Identity and Mutually Supportive Development, , http://www.anafe.org/download/generalites/CR-reunion-annuelle-ZA-2007.pdf, June 3; Makaremi, C., Étudier et assister les étrangers aux frontières (2008) Les Politiques de L'enquête: Épreuves Ethnographiques, , ed.

General Accounting Office: Aviation Security, GAO-04385, February 2004 (hereinafter: US-GAO 2004), p. 5; CAPPS was originally developed by Northwest Airlines in 1994 and has been widely in use by U.S. air carriers since 1998 (see House of Representatives, Subcomittee on Aviation, Hearing on Aviation Security with a Focus on Passenger Profiling, 27 February 2002, at www.house.gov/ transportation/aviation/02-27-02/02-27-02memo.html).

CAPPS II differs from its predecessor in that it performs different analyses, accesses a more diverse spread of data in addition to PNR and is operated by the TSA, not an airline's reservation system (see US-GAO 2004, p. 2; cf. 69 Fed. Reg. 57346 (September 24, 2004)). Cf. 68 Fed. Reg. 45265 (August 1, 2003) on the Passenger and Aviation Security ScreeningRecords, a supporting system to CAPPS II; Details regarding the test phase of Secure Flight since 2004 are available in the TSA Notices in 69 Fed. Reg. 57342, 57345 and 57352 (September 24, 2004), 69 Fed. Reg. 65619 (November 15, 2004). Development of the new system was also slow, met considerable difficulties and finally had to be suspended and thoroughly reviewed in February 2006 (see. www.tsa.gov/public/ display?theme=47&content=090005198 01a8541). A supplementary project was 'Registered Traveller', announced on 20 January 2006, in which passengers, on a voluntary basis and with the aim of accelerating screening processes, would store their biometric data on smart cards and have them checked before flight (see www.tsa.gov/public/display? theme=44&content=09000519801a0136); See US-GAO 2004, pp. 41-44 and also, regarding the Secure Flight Program, the detailed TSA Notice in 69 Fed. Reg. 65619 (November 15,2004). According to the European Parliament, U.S. data protection law is insufficient (see Point I. of the European Parliament resolution on the draft Commission decision noting the adequate level of protection provided for personal data contained in the Passenger Name Records (PNRs) transferred to the US Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (P5_TA(2004)0245) (31 March 2004), OJ C 103E of 29 April 2004, p. 665 (hereinafter: Parliament resolution 245) in relation to the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, specific provisions, the Freedom of Information Act and the 1974 Privacy Act); Agreement between the European Community and the United States of America on the processing and transfer of PNR data by air carriers to the United States Department of Homeland Security, Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, attached to the Council decision of 17 May 2004 the conclusion of an Agreement between the European Community and the United States of America on the processing and transfer of PNR data by Air Carriers to the United States Department of Homeland Security, Bureau of Customs and Border Protection 2004/496/EC, OJ L 183 of 20 May 2004, p. 83; See 19 C.F.R. §122.49a(a) (manifests; only carriers flying to the U.S. are required to transmit them) and 19 C.F.R. §122.49b(a) (PNR) (introduced by 66 Fed. Reg. 67484 (December 31, 2001) and by 67 Fed. Reg. 42712 (June 25, 2002)); See 19 C.F.R. §122.49a, introduced by 66 Fed. Reg. 67482 (December 31, 2001) and specifying 49 U.S.C. §44909(c) (2) (A)-(E) (according to 66 Fed. Reg. 67482 (December 31, 2001), right column). The number of the information contained in the manifests has been considerably increased by section 115 of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (= 49 U.S.C. §44909 (c)) in comparison to the formerly in force 49 U.S.C. §44909(a)-(b). According to 49 U.S.C. §44909(c) (1 -(2), manifests must be provided to the Commissioner of Customs by electronic transmission, in particular through the Advance Passenger Information System (APIS), which was apparently established on the basis of 19 U.S.C. §1431 (d) (1) (C); See 19 C.F.R. §122.49b, introduced by 67 Fed. Reg. 42712 (June 25, 2002) and implementing section 115 of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, itself introduced by 49 U.S.C. §44909 (c) (3). PNR are processed in the Computerised Reservation System (CRS) of each air carrier (cf. Communication from the Commission to the Council and the Parliament, COM (2003) 826 final of 16 December 2003, p. 3 and Association of European Airlines: Yearbook 05, p. 58); 19 GER. §122.49b(b). According to this provision, these are principally data related to the identity and travel plans of a passenger and in any case all data stored in an air carrier's reservation and/or departure control system (under CAPPS II, airlines would be obliged to collect at least four pieces of information, cf. US-GAO 2004, p. 6); 19 C.F.R. §122.49a(a).U.S. Customs are not the only authority to which airlines must provide passenger data. According to the Enhanced Border Security and VISA Entry Reform Act of 2002 (EBSA, Public Law 107-173 of 14 May 2002, carriers must transmit to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) data, Passenger Manifests, greater in number than the manifests destined for U.S. Customs and which can, if needed, be expanded (see section 402 of the EBSA, amending section 231 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1221, Non-compliant carriers are, among other things, fined with $1000 per passenger (8 U.S.C. §1221 (g, The Article 29 Data Protection Working Party also notes that the data is transmitted to two different U.S. authorities, see its Opinion 6/2002, WP 66, MARKT/11647/ 02/EN of 24 October 2002 hereinafter: Art. 29 Working Party, 6/2002, p. 2; US-GAO 2004, pp. 6 et seq. A further data processing system, the U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status Technology (US-VISIT), was to be linked to CAPPS II (see 68 Fed. Reg. 45266 (August 1, 2003)); See the exact description of the Secure Flight Program in its test phase, in 69 Fed. Reg. 57345 (September 24, 2004). Among other things, PNR data are compared to names contained in the Terrorist Screening Database (TSB) of the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) and to a streamlined version of the existing CAPPS rule set associated with suspicious travel behaviour; a random element in the new program prevents its reverse engineering; use of commercial data is also tested. -; Cf. the TSA press release of 26 August 2004, at www.tsa.gov/public/ display?content=090005198OOc6c77; Fed, (2004), 69, Reg. 57346 September 24; 68 Fed.

Article 25 in conjunction with Article 26 Dir. 95/46/EC; Sectoral, apart from the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. §552a). Specific to the PNR data transfer are, according to Gubitz, 'The U.S. Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001 in conflict with the E.U. Data Protection Laws' (2005) New Eng. L. Rev. 449 probably the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. §552) and the Privacy Act; Another particular decision on adequacy beside the one on PNR transfer is that establishing the 'safe harbor' system see infra note 37;; see also Gola/Schomerus, Bundesdatenschutzgesetz (München: Beck 2005), §4b, paragraph 14); An airline which for this reason refuses to deliver PNR data to the USA could, however, contest a possible penalty imposed by the DHS, in particular on the ground that the latter exceeded the powers conferred to it by the U.S. Constitution or that it infringed the U.S. Administrative Procedure Act (APA, see Roos, Safe on the Ground, Exposed in the Sky, 2005) Transnat'l L. & Contemp. Probs. 1137 1160; www.cbpweb.nl/downloads_uit/z2004-0310.pdf?refer=true&theme=purple, This could have occurred in the case of Northwest Airlines transferring passenger data to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 2001 see the letter of the Dutch data protection authority of 30 March 2004 to Northwest, at; By contrast, direct sanctions by the European Community on the basis of the Council Regulation No. 2299/89 of 24 July 1989 on a code of conduct for computerized reservation systems are not probable, the reason being that the provisions on data protection of Article 6 of the Regulation do not seem to be infringed by the data transfer to the USA (cf. Frits Bolkestein's Address to Europma Parliament Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, SPEECH/03/396 of 9 September 2003, p. 4); See infra note 140; The number of the passengers concerned is estimated at 10-11 million yearly (Art. 29 Data Protection Working Party, Opinion 4/2003, WP 78, MARKT/11070/03/EN of 13 January 2003 (hereinafter: Art. 29 Working Party, 4/2003), p. 3); The latter having been established by the Commission decision of 26 July 2000 pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the adequacy of the protection provided by the safe harbour privacy principles and related frequently asked questions issued by the US Department of Commerce (2000/520/EC, OJ L 218 of 25 August 2000, p. 7 (hereinafter: Safe harbor decision, According to Art. 29 Working Party, 6/2002, pp. 5 et seq, the 'Safe Harbor' principles cannot enter into play for data transfers to government authorities [such as the CBP, cf.

The U.S. - EU Joint Statement: U.S. and EU Complete First Annual Review of Airline Passenger Data of 21 September 2005 (as yet unpublished) does not, however, confirm the form of the transfer, but merely notes that '[t]he discussions were candid and constructive'; Conclusion of a survey carried out by the author from 16 January to 2 February 2006 with the members of the AEA performing flights to the USA. Of all the airlines to comment on the PNR question, only Swiss (generally not bound by EC regulations) was providing PNR data to the USA since 5 February 2003, except sensitive ones, which are deleted prior to transmission; Austrian Airlines was 'pushing' to CBP only ten PNR fields. Lufthansa was providing since 5 February 2003 its PNR in a 'pull' form (on 30 May 2006, activation of a 'push' form was still in plan); on its web site, one reads, furthermore, of the transfer of 'passport data' in the context of APIS (see www.lufthansa.com/online/portal/lh/de/ nonav/generalinfo/generalinfo_xd_e/ privacy_statement?l=en&nodeid=799648 ); British Airways transfers PNR (see www.britishairways.com/travel/ askbainter/public/en_gb?p_search_text=PNR); and APIS data as well (see www.britishairways.com/travel/ba6.jsp/imminfo/ public/en_gb) to the USA.

Aside from PNR, guidelines of the World Customs Organization (WCO) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) also regulate Advance Passenger Information (API) systems and have been reviewed in the aftermath of 11 September 2001 (see ICAO FAL/12-WP/60 of 10 March 2004, pp. 1 et seq.); Contained in Article 29 Working Party, Opinion 8/2004, WP 97, MARKT/ 11733/04/EN of 30 Sep. 2004, pp. 3-7; This independent advisory body of the European Union in data protection issues, set up pursuant to Article 29 Dir. 95/46/EC, is considered an authority on, among other things, the CBP-PNR data transfer question; Cf. the Press release of the German Commissioner for Data Protection (Bundesdatenschutzbeauftragter) of 27 Sep. 2006, at www.bfdi.bund.de/cln_029/nn_533554/DE/Oeffentlichkeitsarbeit/ Pressemitteilungen/2006/PM-; Cf.

Investigating the role of Frontex, the European border management agency, this article reveals that border management in the Mediterranean is a fragmented policy that presents internal and external challenges. First, at an internal level, border management remains a sensitive issue where the principles of burden sharing and solidarity between EU member states are difficult to operationalize. Second, at an external level, effective border management is dependent on cooperation with EU's neighbours, as the Spanish-Moroccan case demonstrates. Lastly, along with these internal and external challenges, border management raises some crucial issues about the opportunity of externalizing surveillance technologies to authoritarian regimes. © 2008, Centre of International Studies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2007) European border security agency intercepts 188 more migrants; Albahari, M., (2006) Death and the modern state: making borders and sovereignty at the Southern edges of Europe, , San Diego: University of California; (2006) Middle East biometrics security market to witness new regional projects and developments in 2006, , http://www.albawaba.com/en/countries/uae/193767, >, accessed 9 May 2007; Anderson, M., Bort, E., (2001) The frontiers of the European Union, , New York: Palgrave; Belguendouz, A., Marruecos: ¿socio o guardián de Europa en el norte de Africa?

It was noted in that Report that the existing problems in judicial and enforcement agencies’ cooperation across the EU made the use of national criminal records as a means of combating organised crime rather problematic. It was pointed out that practical problems hindered the speed, access and effectiveness of existing methods of cooperation and the creation and use of an ECR was the way forward for the effective combating of organised crime. Of course, the idea of using databases as a means of combating crime is not new. Practically all enforcement agencies around the world use ‘files’ (in paper or digital form) on crimes, suspects and methods (modus operandi) in an attempt to prevent crime or prosecute criminals. In fact, in recent years digital databases such as the Schengen Information System (SIS) have become the first line of defence against transnational organised crime and plans to update and develop further the system into a SIS II are on the way. What makes the proposal for an ECR different is the idea of an EU-wide dedicated database which addresses the problem directly: in other words, a dedicated database which contains information extracted from national criminal records on selected crimes. © Cambridge University Press 2008 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Stefanou, C., Xanthaki, H., (2005) Financial Crime in the EU: Criminal Records as Effective Tools or Missed Opportunities?, , (The Hague, Kluwer Law International); Stefanou, C., Organised Crime and the Use of EU-wide Databases (2006) International and European Financial Law, pp. 215-218. , I.

Steps in this direction have taken the form of initiatives aiming both at eliminating obstacles to the exchange of personal data between national authorities and at creating EU-wide structures and databases. The emphasis on developing EU-wide databases can be witnessed in both the immigration and asylum field (with the establishment of the EURODAC and Schengen Information System (SIS) databases and proposals to establish a Visa Information System (VIS) in the pipeline) and the criminal law/policing field (the Europol database and part of the SIS database being prime examples). Political reactions to terrorist attacks this decade have led to calls for increasingly linking these databases (notwithstanding their different purpose) and increasing their ‘interoperability’ – a strategy clearly visible in the 2004 Hague Programme, a five-year renewal of the EU Justice and Home Affairs strategy. The Hague Programme also calls for the further facilitation of bilateral information exchanges in the police field under the so-called ‘principle of availability’ and for the ‘deepening’ of surveillance by the use of biometrics in the various databases. © Cambridge University Press 2008 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Fijnaut, C.J.F., The 'Communitization'' of Police Cooperation in Western Europe (1993) Free Movement of Persons in Europe.

This is a response to new spatialities of migration control which are continually reconfigured in an effort to eliminate clandestine movement. In the trans-Saharan region, this pattern of fragmented journeys also arises from a network of transnational social organisations that depend upon newly available technologies. Migrants' social networks provide both the means and the motivation for continued movement, even as destinations become more elusive.

Specifically, I examine the expanding scope and implications of biometric surveillance technologies in liberal states’ border securitization practices. Since 9/11, biometric identification systems have been fast‐tracked as a “silver‐bullet solution” to address perceived threats to border security in the United States and the European Union. I argue that the deployment of new information and biometric technologies in the United States and the European Union is both individuating and expanding state space into new geographies (i.e., state control is extensifying inside bodies and reaching outside sovereign territorial boundaries). This is due, in part, to the deployment and growing interoperability of new border securitization technologies, like US‐VISIT in the United States and the second generation of the Schengen Information System (SIS II) and Visa Information System (VIS) in the European Union. Biometric systems augment efforts to create a high‐concept, multi‐layered, interoperable system of “virtual borders” designed to deter or intercept determined terrorists, criminals, and unauthorized migrants. As the deployment of biometric technologies creep from the margins to the mainstream, privacy and surveillance concerns will become evermore salient. Equally important are the implications of this incremental “disembodied integration” of people with states on how liberal bionetwork societies make decisions about belonging and exclusion. As virtual borders extend into our bodies and around the globe, securitization measures that intersect bodies and states require a virtual theory to account for these new geographies of state space and the qualitative affects on individuals. © 2007, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ackleson, J., Border Security Technologies: Local and Regional Implications (2005) Review of Policy Research, 22 (2), pp. 137-156; Agamben, G., (1998) Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life, , Heller‐Roazen D., (ed), Stanford: Stanford University Press, Edited by; Agamben, G., Bodies Without Words: Against the Biopolitical Tatoo (2004) German Law Journal, 5, pp. 367-369; Agathangelou, A.M., Ling, L.H.M., Power, Borders, Security, Wealth: Lessons of Violence and Desire from September 11 (2004) International Studies Quarterly, 48, pp. 517-538; Alkire, S., (2001) A Conceptual Framework for Human Security.

Because borders and immigration policy alone cannot stop irregular migration, many governments turn to internal migration control on settled irregular migrants. Surveillance of this group is aimed at their exclusion from key societal institutions, discouraging their stay and ultimately, the deportation of apprehended irregular migrants. These are policies in which identification of irregular migrants is crucial. In this age, registration and identification mean computerized and networked databases. The member states of the EU are currently developing a network of databases in the field of (irregular) immigration. The Schengen Information System (II), the Eurodac database and the Visa Information System are vast databases, often including biometric data, aimed at controlling migration flows and identifying and sorting legal and irregular migrants. These systems are able to 're-identify' parts of the population of irregular migrants on the basis of digital traces of their migration history. It is argued that the digital infrastructure that is now growing past its infancy is developing into a formidable tool for the surveillance of irregular migrants in Europe. ©International Sociological Association.","Databases; European Union; Irregular migration; Social sorting; Surveillance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aus, J., (2003) 'Supranational Governance in An ""area of Freedom, Security and Justice"": Eurodac and the Politics of Biometric Control', , www.sussex.ac.uk/sei/documents/wp72.pdf, Sussex European Institute; at:; Bauman, Z., (1998) Globalization: The Human Consequences, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Bauman, Z., (2000) Liquid Modernity, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Bigo, D., 'Criminalisation of ""migrants"": The Side Effect of the Will to Control the Frontiers and the Sovereign Illusion' (2004) Irregular Migration and Human Rights: Theoretical, European and International Perspectives, pp. 90-127. , B.

Now terrorism is not the only issue in the new security agenda, and we appear to have stopped rushing our legislative processes. Yet, policies are still emerging with a lack of public discourse and legislative deliberation. This article reviews two such policies: access to personal information held by airlines and new border practices that include the collection and processing of biometrics. By looking at the negotiations between the U.S. and the European Commission on passenger name records (PNR), the debates in Canada regarding the collection of passenger information, and the deployment of the US-VISIT system, we identify a number of policy dynamics. We can see within these dynamics of policy formation some essential ingredients for discourse and deliberation, which may inform future debates. In particular, this article argues that we may inform policy by looking at the international, regulatory, legal, and technological dynamics of policy. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The right to move freely represents one of the fundamental freedoms of the internal market as well as an essential political element of the package of rights linked to the very status of EU citizenship. The scope ratione personae and the current state of the principle of free movement of persons is assessed by looking at the most recent case law of the Court of Justice and the recently adopted Directive on the rights of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States. But what are the hidden and visible obstacles to free movement of persons in Europe? How can these barriers be overcome to make free movement and residence rights more inclusive? This article addresses these issues along with the following questions: Who are the beneficiaries of the free movement of persons in an enlarged Europe? What is the impact of the recent legal developments in the freedom of movement dimension, such as the European Court of Justice case law and the new Directive? And to what extent are pro-security policies such as the Schengen Information System II and an enhanced interoperability between European databases fully compatible with the freedom of movement paradigm?. © 2017 Wiley.

Finally, it suggests the development of a Global Agreement linking security and other maritime trade-related issues. The initiative for such an agreement should be undertaken by the EU only if current International Maritime Organisation (IMO) efforts fail to produce a maritime security framework with binding requirements and after the wider impact of US security measures has been properly assessed (Flynn, 2002). The September 11 events have revealed the soft underbelly of globalisation. The liberalisation of markets and the resulting facilitation of trade and travel allow terrorists to do their worst. Existing border-management architectures provide no guarantees that terrorists can be prevented from reaching their targets. Furthermore, market pressures are now forcing transport companies to embrace higher standards and adopt technologies and processes that can make border control less relevant. Preoccupation with the urgency of domestic security issues has encouraged the US to develop security standards and urge the rest of the world to adopt their approach or to engage in direct negotiations with them. The US approach is two-fold: it is based on the early detection and interception of terrorists (by moving control away from borders to points-of-origin) who seek to exploit or target the international transport networks coupled with cooperation on data gathering and information sharing.1 These two aspects have shaped US initiatives and legislations such as the Container Security Initiative (CSI) (US Customs 2002), the ‘Port and Maritime Security Act of 2001’ and the ‘Maritime Transportation Antiterrorism Act of 2002’.2 These two legislative Acts and the CSI initiative aim at enhancing security, while at the same time furthering US strategic interests in security-related trade issues and strengthening the US maritime industry's position in order to make it more competitive (Lloyd's List, February 2002). There is a need to study the wider implications of US maritime security initiatives and assess US intentions within the context of international maritime trade. US-driven maritime security initiatives and the current fragmentation of efforts of international organisations such as IMO, World Customs Organisation, International Labour Organisation, and International Standards Organisation, if are not checked by the international maritime community (through a global agreement), may ultimately enable the US to impose its requirements on the rest of the world and affect the operations of international shipping. There is no doubt that current efforts to secure new maritime security consensus through the IMO is a step in the right direction. The amended Chapter XI of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention and the Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS Code) although fundamental to a global security do not cover containers. However, given the multiplicity of actors involved, existing arrangements may not guarantee the required coordination in particular with the WCO. Furthermore, it is not certain that input from the various organisations with varying degrees of expertise will dovetail with IMO work already underway. In order to deal with the consequences and pitfalls of the US initiatives and cope with the fragmentation of international efforts, the development of a Global Agreement should be considered to weld all the stakeholders in a legally binding international framework. A Global Agreement may prove to be a much more cost-effective way of enhancing maritime security globally and restraining US ‘hegemonic’ ambitions and unilateralism in maritime trade. © 2003 Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.

It is based upon an analysis of special data records, including surveillance of national and alien suspects, asylum and deportations, 'border repulsion of undesirable persons', etc. provided to the press by the Greek Schengen Bureau. Some comparisons are made with other Schengen counterparts. The analysis illustrates those particular geopolitical and sociopolitical control imperatives that actually affect the efficiency of the Schengen Agreement in Greece. Based also on other documented evidence, I conclude that Schengen's impact is a mixed blessing for Greek and European citizens as regards both their free movement, and also potential violations of their privacy and civil liberties. It is clearly an 'immigration anathema' to build a 'Fortress Europe', especially as regards Third World immigrants' and refugees' rights and life chances in the EU.","Asylum-seekers; Fortress Europe; Greece; Immigrants; Schengen information system","asylum seeker; human rights; immigrant population; immigration policy; Greece",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gordon, P., (1989) Policing Immigration: Britain's Internal Controls, , London: Pluto Press; Guild, E., Niessen, J., (1996) The Developing Immigration and Asylum Policies of the EU, , The Hague: Kluwer Law International; Huysmans, J., Migrants as a security problem: Dangers of ""securitizing"" societal issues (1995) Migration and European Integration, pp. 53-72. , Miles, R. and Thränhardt, D.

Two main models of migration and incorporation dominated academic and policy approaches in the late twentieth century: first, the settler model, according to which immigrants gradually integrated into economic and social relations, re-united or formed families and eventually became assimilated into the host society (sometimes over two or three generations); second, the temporary migration model, according to which migrant workers stayed in the host country for a limited period, and maintained their affiliation with their country of origin. Globalization, defined as a proliferation of cross-border flows and transnational networks, has changed the context for migration. New technologies of communication and transport allow frequent and multi-directional flows of people, ideas and cultural symbols. The erosion of nation-state sovereignty and autonomy weakens systems of border-control and migrant assimilation. The result is the transformation of the material and cultural practices associated with migration and community formation, and the blurring of boundaries between different categories of migrants. These trends will be illustrated through case-studies of a number of Asian and European immigration countries. It is important to re-think our understanding of the migratory process, to understand new forms of mobility and incorporation, particularly the emergence of transnational communities, multiple identities and multi-layered citizenship.",,"community development; globalization; international migration; migration determinant; mobility; Asia; Europe",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adepoju, A., Issues and recent trends in international migration in Sub-Saharan Africa (2000) International Social Science Journal, 165, pp. 383-394; Aguilar, F.V.J., The triumph of instrumental citizenship?

The communication and co-operation between these system components is increasingly.crossing organisational, regional and even national borders using open networks including the Internet. Such interoperability must be provided in a secure way. Therefore, the different programmes launched by the European Commission dealing with informatics, telematics and the challenges of the Information Society also concern security-related projects. Value-adding the results of several projects within both the TAP and the ISIS programme of the EC as ISHTAR or TRUSTHEALTH on the one hand and MEDSEC or EUROMED-ETS on the other, a regional pilot in oncology for a secure health network has been developed and implemented. Specifying domains and their security policy, security requirements and solutions depending on the systems architecture and behaviour have been defined. Additionally to firewalls at the domain borders, security services based on cryptographic algorithms must be provided which concern application security and/or communication security according to the general security model specified, also taking into account that most of the attacks to domains are caused by insiders. Domains, policies and policy bridging are discussed under the view of security concepts and the concepts-services-mechanisms-algorithms-data relationships developed. Looking for the specific requirements of secure communications in open networks, communication security services and mechanisms will be presented. In that context, an open communication security solution regarding secure messaging (secure EDI) as well as secure channels (SSL and TLS in WWW environments) has been developed and implemented and will be demonstrated in detail. The corresponding security infrastructure needed as user authentication tokens (Health Professional Cards = HPC) and Trusted Third Party (TTP) services are content of another paper in this volume.","Accountability; Application; Authentication; Communication; Confidentiality; Integrity; Internet; Networks; Security","Cryptography; Information analysis; Internet; Network protocols; Project management; Standardization; World Wide Web; Application authentication; Integrity; Internet communication; Security networks; Telecommunication networks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Barber, B., Treacher, A., Louwerse, K., (1996) Towards Security in Medical Telematics, , IOS Press, Amsterdam; Blobel, B., Clinical record systems in oncology.

Rather than IT rendering the body irrelevant to identity -a mistaken idea to begin with -the coupling of biometrics with IT unequivocally puts the body center stage. The questions to be raised about biometrics is how bodies will become related to identity, and what the normative and political ramifications of this coupling will be. Unlike the body rendered knowable in the biomedical sciences, biometrics generates a readable body: it transforms the body's surfaces and characteristics into digital codes and ciphers to be 'read' by a machine. ""Your iris is read, in the same way that your voice can be printed, and your fingerprint can be read"", by computers that, in turn, have become ""touch-sensitive"", and endowed with seeing and hearing capacities. Thus transformed into readable ""text"", the meaning and significance of the biometric body will be contingent upon ""context"", and the relations established with other ""texts"". These metaphors open up ways to investigate the different meanings that will become attached to the biometric body and the ways in which it will be tied to identity.

This sets the stage for future developments, which are presented in the form of three different scenarios. In the European Decline scenario Europe cannot match developments in the US and Japan.

While the promotion of high technology sectors has become a major priority of European policy in recent years, the growing physical presence of subsidiaries of foreign multinational companies (MNCs) in the European Union (EU) has complicated the issue of what the promotion of ‘European high technology industry’ means. In practice, a large number of ‘foreign’ subsidiaries from EFTA and the US gain access to important European technology programmes such as ESPRIT, RACE, BRITE and EUREKA, as well as some national programmes. However, this has not been true for most subsidiaries of Japanese firms, despite the increasingly large presence they have in the European economy. This article asks what can explain this outcome. Two important cases which have brought issues of foreign firm access to the fore of European technology policy‐making, IBM and ICL‐Fujitsu, are examined. Both European corporate and state preferences need to be understood in order to explain outcomes in these cases. The argument is that a ‘technological Fortress Europe’ has not been a real policy option because European national champions have been unable to agree, and because certain governments, such as the UK, have perceived an interest in promoting foreign MNCs. European governments and institutions have moved towards a policy based more upon the location of economic activity rather than the ownership of assets. The article also suggests that theorists seeking to understand the consequences of globalization must consider not only how foreign investment, local production and alliances with local partners affect host state and corporate preferences, but also why broader cultural and historical factors also affect outcomes. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Corporate identity; European integration; Globalization; R & D; Semiconductors; Technology policy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(1992) The Highest Stakes, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Buigues, P., Ilzkovitz, F., Lebrun, J.-F., (1990) The Impact of The Internal Market by Industrial Sector: The Challenge for The Member States, , European Economy, special edition; De Vos Jon, A.P., (1989) Deputy Assistant Secretary for Science and Technology Affairs, , Department of State, testimony to House Committee on Science, Space and Technology; Dosi, G., Pavitt, K., Soete, L., (1990) The Economics of Technical Change and International Trade, , Brighton: Harvester-Wheatsheaf; Dunning, J.H., (1993) The Globalization of Business, , London: Routledge; Flamm, K., Semiconductors (1990) Europe 1992: An American Perspective, , Gary C.

But the existence of databases ranging from the relatively unsophisticated Schengen Information System and the proposed European Information System to the UCLAF system to combat fraud raises many legal and criminological issues. There is a danger that the database and profiling approach exaggerates the scale of organised crime to excuse unwarranted interference with civil liberties, and it is not easy to keep large databases secure from hackers. There is no proper mechanism for complaining about abuses, and there may be inadequate protection for political dissidents. On the other hand pooling of information enables the authorities to allocate scarce resources to the most harmful crimes and can help to minimise unwarranted invasions of privacy. National SIRENE bureaux provide judicial and administrative checks by filtering individual requests for information from databases, and safeguards have been built into the procedures for accessing the IRENE-3 database.

The Single European Act, the Schengen agreement, the Treaty of Maastricht, and the creation of the European Economic Area, have led to moves towards migration policy harmonisation in the West. New migration pressures, related to political events in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, the rise in asylum applications, and emigration from the poorer countries of the South, have given the harmonisation process added impetus. These trends have made it desirable to establish an information system to inform policy makers on current international migration trends. The system, presented here, allows evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of existing information sources, enables contemporary patterns and trends in European international migration, together with the processes creating them, to be discerned, and serves as a basis for identifying pertinent new research issues. Successive sections deal with: the information system (source inventories, tables, bibliography) and contemproary trends (typology, demography and economic background, stocks amd flows, migration in the Mediterranean region and in E.

A large number of schemes has been established, mainly in the U.S.A., but also in Western Europe. For the majority of these projects the aim has been to maximise gas recovery at already completed sites, or sections of sites. Gas recovery plant design has been almost purely ""retro-fit"" in concept. This approach can be costly both in terms of capital-overspend as well as possible ineffectiveness of gas leakage (or migration) control. Moreover, the ""Western"" methodology is generally inappropriate to landfills in Eastern European countries owing to the differing characteristics of landfill design such as surface cover placement, division of the site into cells, leachate and surface water collection. However, by considering carefully the special characteristics of these sites and, most significantly, adopting an ""integrated design"" approach, then energy recovery from landfill gas can be both profitable and environmentally beneficial. The aim of this paper is to identify the key factors which influence landfill gas collection effectiveness and to incorporate these in an overall site design strategy. In this way, the gas collection plant is optimised and linked directly to a specification for the site final cover contour. Simple design procedures are employed and the modelling and analysis aspects are short, concise and readily verifiable. This new methodology is discussed in detail and the design techniques are applied to a ""national"" Eastern European site. © 1990.",,"Gas Migration Control; Landfill Gas Control; Landfill Gas Mitigation Generation; Leachate; Municipal Solid Wastes; Biogas--Production; Energy Resources--Recovery; Gases--Recovery; Land Fill; biogas; conference paper; domestic waste; energy resource; landfill; solid waste management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Richards, Landfill gas — the sweet smell of success.
