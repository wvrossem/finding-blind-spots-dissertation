This paper enhances the theoretical debate on migration with new ways of understanding borders and space as fluid, autonomous, and provisional linkages between humans and nonhumans. Based on findings from field research conducted in Greece, it aims to discuss how migrants' digital practices generate new spaces and materialities. Attending to the making of migrants’-ICTs intertwining it examines the emergence of unbordering practices, the creation of crucial solidarity networks and the risks and limitations that emerge when using ICTs. Finally, the paper highlights the recent migratory influx not simply as a result of neoliberal doctrines, but (also) as an act of disobedience to fortress Europe through the creation of digital-urban heterotopias through the lenses of Migration Studies, Science and Technology Studies and Critical spatial theory. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Heterotopia; ICTs; Migration; Multiple; Space","digital image; immigrant; information and communication technology; innovation; population migration; technological development; Greece",,,,,,,,,,,,"Galis, V.; IT University of CopenhagenDenmark; email: vasilis.galis@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",09626298,,,,"English","Polit.

Drawing on both International Relations and criminology, it develops an analytical framework to identify the political rationalities and technologies of crime control that the EU attempts to transfer across the Eastern and Southern (extended) neighbourhoods. By scrutinising 216 projects aimed at combating transnational crime beyond Europe's borders, spanning law enforcement, border security, criminal justice, and the penitentiary sector, the empirical analysis is geared towards detecting and systematising the ways of thinking and doing crime control that the EU seeks to promote and export. Moreover, it investigates the 'action at a distance' whereby it does so. It is argued that in shaping third countries' ability to criminalise, police, indict, convict, and punish, the EU is simultaneously defining its own security actorness, specifically consolidating its role as a 'global crime fighter'.

Drawing on the concept of border performativity, this article discusses how data is transforming the border. In particular, the article focuses on 1) how the EU JHA databases are evolving, from separate systems each with one purpose to multi-purpose databases, and 2) how the new EU plan – the interoperability regulation – connects and merges biometric and biographical data, as part of a shift from a silo-based approach towards a single centralised information system. The article - based on results of several research projects carried out between 2011 and 2019 adopting mixed methodology - discusses the border crossers’ role in challenging this digital border control, both in light of the current practices of data collection and processing and newly approved EU regulations. The article argues that the transformation of border control practices into practices driven by data processing makes it more difficult for border crossers to manoeuvre the system and legally challenge decisions based on data processing, thus, hampering the transformation of the border from below. © The Author(s) 2022.","borders; crimmigration; databases; European union; technology",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ferraris, V.; Law Department, Italy; email: valeria.ferraris@unito.it",,"SAGE Publications Inc.",14773708,,,,"English","Eur.

Funded under the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 programme, the system is analysed in relation to the wider political economy of ‘emotional AI’ and the history of deception detection technologies. We then move on to interrogate the design of iBorderCtrl using publicly available documents and assess the assumptions and scientific validation underpinning the project design. Finally, drawing on a Bayesian analysis we outline statistical fallacies in the foundational premise of mass screening and argue that it is very unlikely that the model that iBorderCtrl provides for deception detection would work in practice. By interrogating actual systems in this way, we argue that we can begin to question the very premise of the development of data-driven systems, and emotional AI and deception detection in particular, pushing back on the assumption that these systems are fulfilling the tasks they claim to be attending to and instead ask what function such projects carry out in the creation of subjects and management of populations.

They materialize as unruly, unstable and failing infrastructures that are governed through maintenance in order to correct any identified functional anomalies and address potential future failures by adapting them to emerging technologies and the service needs of end-users (e.g. border guards, police). To conceptualize the maintenance labour through which information systems are governed, I synthesize ideas developed in Michel Foucault’s work on biopolitics and governmentality with contributions that explore the agentic forces and proclivities of technoscientific matter. By unearthing the very mechanics of maintenance processes, I make two contributions to the literature that interrogates the digitization and smartening of border security. First, I demonstrate that attending to maintenance permits a more complete understanding of the agency of information systems. Second, I broaden the research agenda that explores border security as practice by directing attention towards the often invisible, but politically significant, labour of maintainers who, by rendering information systems functional, sustain the power to govern international mobility by digital means. © The Author(s) 2020.","Border security; information systems; maintenance; Michel Foucault; New Materialisms",,"Leverhulme Trust: 2014-097; Università degli Studi di Trento, UNITN","The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research has been funded by the Leverhulme Trust (grant number 2014-097) and the School of International Studies at the University of Trento (project STERI: Science, Technology and International Relations).","I am truly grateful to Debbie Lisle, Rocco Bellanova and Peter Forman for their valuable feedback on previous versions of this article.

One of its central aims was, by predicting challenges related to increased migration, to improve resource allocation and prevent crime. By drawing on research on risk and threat assessment as a form of power, this article aims to analyze how risk categories are distributed and translated into a multilayered institutional arrangement where migration is policed as a potential crime. The article examines the indicators that the risk assessments are based on, and the measures applied and investigates how discretionary practices make immigrants objects for law enforcement and policing. The article contributes to research on migration control in an ordinary police context, where immigration identity checks become part of the crime reduction strategy. Applying the concept of interpretive flexibility (Collins 1981), I will identify the steps in this chain of translation to explore the leap from targeting potentially criminal asylum seekers to targeting broader groups with temporary residency in Norway. The article analyzes the conditions determining how policing, technologies, and migrants are ""co-constructed"" in a chain of mediation and translation, which reinforces the view of migrants as risky and criminal. The final section discusses how risk and threat analysis is affected by the notion of the ""crimmigrant other"" (Franko 2020).

This method of data visualisation unearths the deep patterns of opposition that run across the sociotechnical universe where European borders are designed and created. We identify three rationalities of power at play: territorial surveillance aimed at detecting rare events in remote areas, policing of dense human flows by sorting out the benign from the dangerous, and finally global dataveillance of cargo on the move. Instead of trends towards either the hardening of borders or their virtualisation, we, therefore, find multiple rationalities of power simultaneously redefining the modalities of control at EU borders. A second finding shows where precisely critical actors are located in this sociotechnical universe and indicates that the structure of European R&D in border security keeps irregularised migrants off their radars.

It presents empirical ethnographic evidence, gathered between January and June 2017, from Skaramagas and Elaionas camps in Athens. Although intended as temporary humanitarian solutions, many migrants have remained in them for long periods, stuck in a state of temporariness. Camps have been studied extensively through the lens of biopolitics as spaces of abandonment and abjectification. More recently, a growing body of literature is highlighting the everyday micro-politics and tactics of belonging that take place within them. Drawing on the latter, I shed light on the temporal aspects of border control involved in camps, arguing that camps provide a temporal, rather than only spatial, technology that governs encamped migrants through the administration of their time. Thus, the camp governs the critical moment between reception and in/exclusion from the polity. Yet, as I show, within this condition of semi-permanence and semi-presence, camp residents, through the practice of everyday life, being present and visible, create places and give new meanings to existing ones. If the border is enacted through the imposed temporalities of the camp, then its subversion can be found in these everyday place-making tactics. Looking into these micro-practices, this paper contributes to the above debates by exploring camps as temporal technologies of control. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Abandonment; Athens; Border temporalities; Borders; Camp geographies; Camps; Elaionas; Ethnography; EU border Regime; Everyday bordering; Governance; Micro-practices; Place-making; Resistance; Skaramagas; Subversion","border region; ethnography; European Union; governance approach; temporal analysis; Athens [Attica]; Attica; Greece","Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: 1632637","This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [Award Reference 1632637 ].",,,,,,,,,,,,"Elsevier Ltd",09626298,,,,"English","Polit.

In the European Union (EU), this trend has been shown by the frequent overlap between asylum application and migration policies and the agenda concerning border control, security, and terrorism. This securitization of migration discourse is claimed to justify the use of controversial practices to examine asylum applications. Against this background, the article reflects on the use of technology-assisted and automated decisions in this area. In particular, it questions whether the existing safeguards provided in the EU data protection framework ensure asylum seekers' rights to privacy and the protection of personal data. In doing so, the article seeks to offer a more nuanced understanding of European asylum policy and the potential flaws therein that allow individuals' fundamental rights-enshrined in the EU Charter and the European Convention on Human Rights-to be infringed. In conclusion, the article engages with the debate relating to the use of automated decisions, in particular those based on artificial intelligence, and whether they should be excluded from certain policy areas, such as migration. © 2021 The Author(s).

An attempt was made to suggest changes to laws and regulations in the field of migration and border protection on the basis of empirical data. The goal is to investigate the mechanism of identification of foreigners and stateless persons during border control procedures at border crossing points (checkpoints) and at entry-exit checkpoints, as well as during administrative proceedings and to identify ways to improve the legal regulation of these procedures in the activities of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine. The methods used in the research were the analysis and comparison of national legislation with the legislation of the European Union Member States and the Council of Europe (including the case law of the European Court of Human Rights) on biometric data. The questionnaire survey method enabled to obtain objective information about the border guards' awareness of personal data. The forecasting method was used to formulate proposals for amendments to the legislation to improve the organization of work processes in the activities of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine when using IT systems.

A field in which this has become particularly salient is digitized EU border management. Here, the framework of responsible research and innovation (RRI) has recently been used to point to the alleged sensitivity of political actors towards the contingent dimensions of emerging security technologies. RRI, in general, is concerned with societal needs and the engagement and inclusion of various stakeholder groups in the research and innovation processes, aiming to anticipate undesired consequences of and identifying socially acceptable alternatives for emerging technologies. However, RRI has also been criticized as an industry-driven attempt to gain societal legitimacy for new technologies. In this article, we argue that while RRI evokes a space where different actors enter co-creative dialogues, it lays bare the specific challenges of governing security innovation in socially responsible ways. Empirically, we draw on the case study of BODEGA, the first EU funded research project to apply the RRI framework to the field of border security. We show how stakeholders involved in the project represent their work in relation to RRI and the resulting benefits and challenges they face. The paper argues that applying the framework to the field of (border) security lays bare its limitations, namely that RRI itself embodies a political agenda, conceals alternative experiences by those on whom security is enacted upon and that its key propositions of openness and transparency are hardly met in practice due to confidentiality agreements. Our hope is to contribute to work on RRI and emerging debates about how the concept can (or cannot) be contextualized for the field of security—a field that might be more in need than any other to consider the ethical dimension of its activities. © 2021, The Author(s).","Innovation; Responsible research and innovation (RRI); Science and technology studies (STS); Security; Smart borders","human; research ethics; Ethics, Research; Humans",,,,,,,,,,,,"Klimburg-Witjes, N.; Department of Science and Technology Studies, Universitätsstrasse 7, Austria; email: Nina.witjes@univie.ac.at",,"Springer Science and Business Media B.V.",13533452,,,"33599880","English","Sci.

Each member state and border practitioner exploits its own set of assets in their goal of border surveillance and control. States have invested significantly in these assets and infrastructures necessary to manage and control the transit in the border areas. As new capabilities and assets become available and as current Command and Control (C2) systems become older, border control practitioners are faced with the increasing challenge of how to integrate new assets, command and control all of them in a coordinated and coherent way without having to invest in a completely new C2 systems built from the ground up. Therefore, and bearing in mind that the systems already developed up to date are very old and are not framed in a global standard data model, it has been identified, on one side the need to define a platform that allows to interact with multiple UxVs (land, sea and air), and on the other, unify all data models so that it can globalize and generate a much more concise analysis of what happens in places of conflict. © 2021. by the authors.","Border Control; Distributed Infrastructure; Situational Awareness; UxVs",,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 740736","This work has been performed under the H2020 740736 project CAMELOT, which has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Program.

The author follows the construction of the FTF as a serious security threat to the European Union’s strategies and action plans, and demonstrates the EU’s practical actions to respond the threat: criminalization of “suspicious travel”, strengthening border security, preliminary screening of asylum seekers at the border. The article pays special attention to the EU plans to achieve compatibility of the European Union information systems, while emphasizing new opportunities for the law enforcement bodies to access migration databases for combating terrorism. Exploring the new EU integration plan for migrants, the author notes that this is for the first time that the European Commission focuses its efforts not only on migrants, but also on the EU citizens with “migratory background”, which is undoubtedly dictated by a fear of the extremist ideology influence on young people. The article exposes certain similarities between the Commission’s methods to coordinate integration and inclusion of migrants, reintegration of the FTF and their families, which indicates that the migration policy is becoming a part of the EU security policy. That leads to a conclusion that securitization of migration policy aims not only and not so much at preventing the potential threat of the returnees’ terrorist activities, but at curbing migration flows as a whole and reducing the number of asylum seekers, in particular. Nevertheless, terrorism and migration seem to be closely linked in public discourse, despite the absence of an empirical basis to conclude that these factors directly influence each other. The author considers the most difficult problem of modern migration policy to be the definition of the red line beyond which its securitization can be justified. © 2021 Olga Yu.

Critical sectors such as transport are progressively depending on digital technologies to run their core operations and develop novel solutions to exploit the economic strengths of the European Union. However, despite the fact that the continuously increasing number of visitors, entering the European Union through land-border crossing points or seaports, brings tremendous economic benefits, novel border control solutions, such as mobile devices for passenger identification for land and sea border control, are essential to accurately identify passengers 'on the fly' while ensuring their comfort. However, the highly confidential personal data managed by these devices makes them an attractive target for cyberattacks. Therefore, novel secure and usable user authentication mechanisms are required to increase the level of security of this kind of devices without interrupting border control activities. Towards this direction, we, firstly, discuss risk-based and adaptive authentication for mobile devices as a suitable approach to deal with the security vs. usability challenge. Besides that, a novel risk-based adaptive user authentication mechanism is proposed for mobile passenger identification devices used by border control officers at land and sea borders. © 2021 IEEE.","adaptive user authentication; border control security; mobile passenger ID devices; risk-based user authentication","Cybersecurity; Mobile telecommunication systems; Adaptive user authentication; Border control; Border control security; Control security; European union; Mobile passenger ID device; Risk-based; Risk-based user authentication; User authentication; Authentication","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: H2020-MSCA-RISE-2019-eBORDER-872878","The research work leading to this publication has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme under grant agreement H2020-MSCA-RISE-2019-eBORDER-872878.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",23784873,9781665417792,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The present article investigates a specific set of measures that involve the harnessing of “new technology” to enact systematic controls on persons traveling across the internal borders of Schengen states, through the processing of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data and in the framework of the EU PNR Directive. It argues that PNR data processing should at the same time be understood as part of the alternatives to border checks available for Member States to regulate cross-border mobility in the Schengen area and as a standout among these measures. PNR data processing challenges the existing legal framework of Article 23(a) of the Schengen Borders Code (SBC) as well as the assessment framework developed by the CJEU in its relevant case-law, not because it contravenes Schengen rules, but because it stretches and overflows them. Ultimately, PNR data processing puts into question the very understanding of what checks performed in relation to the act or intention of crossing a border actually stand for or whether controls related to border crossings can be characterised as border controls. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2021","Free movement; Internal borders; PNR; Schengen; Systematic checks",,,"The author would like to thank colleagues of the ULB's Centre de droit europ?en (CDE) for their invitation to present an earlier version of this text in their internal seminar and for insightful comments.

In our research, we had all identified suspicion as characteristic of migration governance. We saw it in the anxiety-ridden public discourses surrounding ‘unwanted’ immigration, in increasingly repressive legal frameworks, in bureaucratic classification schemes and technologies designed to identify suspected, illegalised travellers or deserving from undeserving asylum applicants, and finally, in the distrustful gaze of street-level bureaucrats enforcing migration law. We had also experienced suspicion directed against us as researchers by the state agencies we were studying. Based on these observations, this introduction develops a conceptual framework of states of suspicion, which captures how suspicion permeates migration control on the individual as well as structural level: as an affective element, as codified in law and institutionalised practice, and as manifested in material border and migration control technologies. The contributions to the special section shed light on these various elements, and taken together, enabling us to capture the constitutive nature of suspicion in contemporary migration control regimes. The special section discusses the implications of suspicion, in particular for those people who are rendered suspicious by default.

This threatens visa-free travel, freedom of settlement and borderland economies in parts of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). It has interrupted historical mobility patterns, depleted the diversity of mobility practices and criminalized regional economies. At the same time, one can observe intensified and asymmetrical violent conflict in some of these borderlands. By taking the Kantchari-Makalondi borderland as a case study we analysed the relations between migration policies, insecurity, forced immobility and economic decline. Our observations and interviews with migrants, traders, security forces and borderlanders lead us to question conventional narratives on border control and African mobilities as a binary relation between Africa and Europe. Instead, they foreground the multiple practices of (im)mobility in these spaces: the circulation and blockage of travelers, merchandise, surveillance technologies, and military interventions and their impact on security and livelihoods. © 2021 The Author(s).

Although border and critical security studies have increasingly focused on the multiple aspects of techno-materiality and infrastructural devices of border control, less has been said about how such an infrastructure encodes and transmits collective future visions of border (in)security. Therefore, this paper analyzes the making of a sociotechnical imaginary of digital transformation of the EU border regime, specifically focusing on the role of eu-LISA, the European agency for the development and management of large-scale IT systems. Drawing on ethnographic observations and interview material, we analyze the ways in which this agency emerges as a site for assembling and rehearsing this sociotechnical imaginary, gradually transforming borders into sites of experimentation in the EU Schengen laboratory. As our case illustrates, studying the visionary dimensions of digital infrastructuring helps us to understand how imagination becomes collectivized and materialized, opens up or closes down sociotechnical realizations, and thus tacitly governs the project of digitally infrastructuring the EU border regime. © The Author(s) 2021.","digitalization; experimental politics; governing migration; infrastructuring borders; sociotechnical imaginary",,"Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, ÖAW: 2018-2021; Universität Wien","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Research for this article was supported by the DOC Fellowship of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (2018-2021) at the Department of Science and Technology Studies, University of Vienna.

States provide migrants’ biometric data to transnational databases that are increasingly interoperable in the area of migration and crime control, to be accessible for state-based law enforcement actors. This article uses the case of Eurodac – a biometric database initially developed for migration control purposes – to explore the ongoing expansion of law enforcement access to the collected information for the purpose of crime control. The article studies how borders are selectively made permeable for biometric data flows in the light of “crimmigration” discourses. It combines insights from critical migration, border, and security studies that address the increasing overlapping of migration and crime control in policy discourse, law, and surveillance technologies.

Recently there has been a considerable increase in the use of computational techniques to predict migration flows, and advances have allowed for application of improved algorithms in the field. However, given the rapid pace of technological development facilitating these new predictive tools and methods for migration, it is important to address the extent to which such instruments and techniques engage with and impact migration governance. This study provides an in‐depth examination of selected existing predictive tools in the migration field and their impact on the governance of migratory flows. It focuses on a comparative qualitative examination of these tools’ scope, as well as how these characteristics link to their respective underlying migration theory, research question, or objective. It overviews how several organisations have developed tools to predict short‐ or longer‐term migration patterns, or to assess and estimate migration uncertain-ties. At the same time, it demonstrates how and why these instruments continue to face limitations that in turn affect migration management, especially as it relates to increasing EU institutional and stakeholder efforts to forecast or predict mixed migration. The main predictive migration tools in use today cover different scopes and uses, and as such are equally valid in shaping the requirements for a future, fully comprehensive predictive migration tool. This article provides clarity on the requirements and features for such a tool and draws conclusions as to the risks and opportunities any such tool could present for the future of EU migration governance. © 2021 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","European union; Forecasting; Migration governance; Predictive tools",,"Open Society Foundations, OSF; International Business Machines Corporation, IBM; Udenrigsministeriet; Horizon 2020: 882986","The authors are grateful to Alexander Kjaerum, Kalev Leetaru, Constantinos Melachrinos, Rebeca Moreno Jimenez, Teddy Wilkin, and Sylvain Ponserre, for their key inputs as part of this study, and to Daniel Morente and Christopher Neeson for their relevant feedback on ear‐ lier drafts of this article.

This Article intends to shine a light from a legal perspective on the ambivalence of the means and ends of the ETIAS database. ETIAS is not solely an instrument of migratory flow management. It is also, more discretely, a criminal justice instrument. In addition to the administrative function of ETIAS, there is a law-enforcement capability: once data pertaining to candidates seeking travel authorization is collected, it becomes available to ends which are estranged from the administrative function of ETIAS. This Article intends to highlight the opaque nature of ETIAS resulting from its cumulating complexities at the crossroads of law and information technology, EU and member states competences, administrative and criminal laws. ETIAS is indicative of a more global model that it is helping to deploy, suggesting the prospect of a data set pertaining to migrants and available for criminal purposes.

Frontex, the European border control agency, is carefully considering new ways to secure European borders and to improve its technological capabilities.34 It is following the development of several projects financed with research funds from the Horizon 2020 programme. Frontex recently signed an agreement with the Directorate-General for Migration and Home Affairs of the European Commission (DG-HOME) for the supervision and implementation of research projects related to border security issues.35 The TRESPASS project aims to implement a risk-based approach in the operations of controlling national borders and regulating the entry of foreigners into the national territory. Algorithms collect and process data to identify, according to certain indicators, the level of “risk” of each possible entry within the state borders.36 The ROBORDER project aims to implement a fully automated and unmanned border surveillance system. More specifically, it is a complex of mobile robotic vehicles capable of operating on any surface.37 The FOLDOUT project aims to create a platform for real-time surveillance of state borders. A set of sensors collects information to inform border guards about possible threats along the borders.38 The aim is to immediately detect any illegal cross-border movement. These are just a few examples of projects that have been considered. Frontex has also evaluated other solutions over the years: digital platforms for remote identification of vessels, biometric scanning and heartbeat recognition systems (to detect migrants hiding in vehicles and containers attempting to cross European borders illegally).39 Algorithmic system can also work for lie detection purposes. The idea is to use these tools to detect if people requesting visas or entry permit are lying about their credentials through the processing of biometric data like facial expressions.","The iBorderCtrl project funded by the European Commission is a clear example of how the use of algorithmic systems at European borders can have worrying results and create dystopian situations. The AI-driven lie-detection system was responsible for checking the reliability and truthfulness of travellers’ statements at border controls to enter European territory. However, the functioning of this mechanism was obscure and not understandable to human observers. There was also a risk that it would take into account variables such as the ethnic origin or nationality of respondents in a discriminatory manner. The iBorderCtrl case illustrates how algorithmic technologies are not inherently neutral, but they act accordingly to purposes determined by actors and stakeholders. As far as fields of public importance like migration management are concerned, elected politicians and lawmakers formulate such purposes. The migration crisis of 2015 and the gradual rise to political power of parties that see immigration as a possible threat has influenced European action. The EU is currently funding the implementation surveillance tools and training programmes for border police in neighbouring countries.102 The aim is to prevent migratory flows currently in circulation from reaching EU territory. This attempt to “outsource” the surveillance of European borders and the management of migratory phenomena to other States raises several concerns. All the more so considering the impact that algorithmic tools can have in such a situation, as explained in this paper. Several EU bodies and agencies are funding these activities for different goals and acting on different legal grounds. The lack of a clear framework of intervention for these programmes is an issue in terms of fundamental rights safeguards. The EU’s increasing focus on the technological control of its borders has led to an increase in the budget for Frontex.103 Similarly, surveillance systems industries are constantly lobbying Frontex officers to influence their actions and therefore increasing their profit opportunities.104 Thus, private economic interests and political pressures can be determining factors in influencing EU action in managing migration phenomena. The EU Member States must cooperate to develop an integrated and collaborative border management policy (Art.77.2 TFEU).105 The principles of solidarity and fair sharing of responsibilities must characterize the European Union’s action in the context of migration and management of its borders (Art.80 TFEU), including the deployment of technological means at the European frontiers. The European Parliament recently did not approve the financial budget of Frontex over concerns about the lack of respect for fundamental rights in the management of migratory flows.106",,,,,,,,,"Forti, M.; Sant’Anna School of Advanced StudiesItaly; email: mirko.forti@santannapisa.it",,"University of Trento",22844503,,,,"English; Spanish","BioLaw J.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108519786

This article claims for EU migrants in pre-Brexit UK, immigration controls have worked through a process of ‘bureaucratic bordering’ that infiltrates the post-arrival regularisation of statuses and affects broader pathways of incorporation. The discussion draws on episodes of participant observation with Bulgarian arrivals to trace the tightening of administrative procedures that ensued in the aftermath of labour market liberalisation in 2014. These are explored for their productive, rather than restrictive potential, namely, for implicating migrants in a bureaucratically induced temporality of ‘protracted arrival’ in the process of which they are stripped off of their formal rights and made dependent on subordinated forms of employment and existence within the confines of the ‘migrant economy’. By exploring the politics and experiences of intra-EU migration through analytical concepts devised for ‘precarious’ movements, such as ‘bordering’, ‘differential inclusion’, and ‘permanent temporariness’, this article questions the incisive conceptual and empirical binaries between internal and external migrations and joins the voices of those warning to the eroding protection of EU citizenship. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bordering; Bulgarian; informal economy; Intra-EU migration; temporality",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Manolova, P.; Migration and Diversity Chair, Germany; email: polina.manolova@gmail.com",,"Routledge",1369183X,,,,"English","J.

It introduces the concept of borderwork ‘creep’, to highlight how border management practices have, in the last 15 years, expanded along three axes. This term borrows from debates on ‘function creep’ in surveillance studies which have generally been focused on digital technologies in the global north. The first axis is a cartographic one, with borderwork functioning through a denial of cartographic limits to border security. Borderwork has crept inland, with security practices taking an expansive vision of the borderland and bringing controls to key inland nodes. The second is that of a cross-pollination of policy areas with a growing role for judicialised modes of justification for borderwork. The third relates to faith in technology, with new digital geographies making borderwork in the Sahel reliant on data handling and sharing. To make these arguments, the article draws on fieldwork since 2013 in Senegal, Mauritania, and Niger. By examining the breadth and expansion of borderwork in the Sahel, it contests visions that centre ‘Fortress Europe’ and instead highlights the multiple often overlapping global and local interests that expand borderwork in the Sahel. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Frowd, P.M.; Faculty of Social Sciences Building, 120 University Private, Canada; email: pfrowd@uottawa.ca",,"Routledge",14650045,,GEOPF,,"English","Geopolit.",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105929982

Focusing on everyday practices illuminated by ethnographic fieldwork, this article investigates EU border externalisation’s encounter with the Sahelian context. It argues that state and non-state actors form, deform and perform borders by extracting and capturing the material (economic) and immaterial (cognitive) resources that pass through liminal spaces.

While much discussion of border struggles focuses on migrants’ resistance and various forms of activism, this paper provides insights on the micro-resistance of those who, instead of overtly opposing and contesting the biopolitical power of border regimes, are integral to their operation: asylum caseworkers who filter and select border-crossers. The paper presents data from interviews with self-identified leftist asylum caseworkers in Greece who, through their work, seek to create cracks in the so-called ‘Fortress Europe’. By exploring the somewhat unexplored occupational culture of leftist asylum caseworkers, we show how, while trying to resist bordering regimes, leftist asylum caseworkers both critique and reproduce the power relations they seek to subvert. Essentially, we provide valuable insights on the limits of resistance due to the workings of powerful technologies of government–informed by neoliberal managerialism–that are operational in day-to-day life of the asylum process. The paper thus provides a novel exploration of the complex and entangled relation between technologies of power and micro-resistances within border regimes in the significant context of Greece. © 2021 The Author(s).

Illustrated through an encounter between a migrant and the Visa Information System (VIS)–one of the largest migration-related biometric databases worldwide–the article’s first part outlines three implications of digitisation. We argue that the VIS assembles a set of previously unconnected state authorities into a group of end users who enact border security and migration management through the gathering, processing and sharing of data; facilitates the practice of traceability, understood as a rationality of mobility control; and has restrictive effects on migrants’ capacity to manoeuvre and resist control. Given these implications, the article’s second part introduces three analytical sensitivities that help to avoid some analytical traps when studying digitisation processes. These sensitivities take their cue from insights and concepts in science and technology studies (STS), specifically material semiotics/ANT approaches. They concern, firstly, the ways that data-based security practices perform the identities of the individuals that they target; secondly, the need to consider possible practices of subversion by migrants to avoid control-biased analyses; and finally, the challenge to study the design and development of border security technologies without falling into either technological or socio-political determinism. © 2020 The Author(s).

Scholars have, however, tended to apprehend dispersal in its geographical dimension, failing to interrogate bordering beyond spatial distancing from the territorial edges of the state. Furthermore, dispersal strategies in non-European countries are underexplored. We start filling these gaps by examining how dispersal operates in Morocco–a country where, since the announcement of a new migration policy in 2013, the routine internal dispersal of groups of dark-skinned people racially profiled as ‘illegal sub-Saharan’ by Moroccan police forces has become commonplace. Drawing on extensive qualitative fieldwork conducted between 2016 and 2019, as well press articles and NGO reports, we advance a dynamic understanding of bordering by analysing how the repeated spatial relocation of migrant people works through and in tandem with mechanisms of dispossession. We draw together literature on dispersal as migration governance and on dispossession as containment, proposing that dispersal activates practices of dispossession that expand the reach of bordering beyond spatial distance, turning it into an embodied technology: migrant people profiled as ‘sub-Saharan’ experience bordering as a form of inflicted hypermobility and a condition of protracted, unbearable living to which they are confined. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bordering; dispersal; dispossession; immigration; Morocco","dispersal; governance approach; immigrant population; immigration; immigration policy; migration; mobility; Morocco","Society for Libyan Studies, SLS; Gates Cambridge Trust","Lorena Gazzotti thanks the Centre Jacques Berque in Rabat and the Society for Lybian Studies for funding field research in the summer 2019.

This paper focuses on the socio-technical architectures that are generative of data mobilities and analyses the temporality of data circulation as the outcome of a contingent formation of various actors, sites, and materials. Based on an indepth analysis of the Frontex information system Joint Operation Reporting Application (JORA), it works out several sources of turbulence that turn data mobility into a ‘crooked’ process of patching multiple temporalities and paces together. It will show how the implementation of JORA faces data frictions, issues of data quality, the synchronization of multiple orderings, and the clash of temporalities of border control practices on the ground. Thus, the infrastructuring of data circulation has effects on interorganizational forms of collaboration and knowledge production as well as on border work in the field of European migration and border control. © 2020 The Author(s).

The Danish Immigration Service’s age decision-making process articulates a form of administrative rule that works to depoliticise questions of dispossession and death, and is a form of colonial violence enabled by humanitarian discourse and law. © 2020 Institute of Race Relations.","Afghanistan; biometric surveillance; Danish Immigration Service; Denmark; Eurodac; imperialist technology; medical age assessments; unaccompanied minors; ‘war on terror’","Afghan; Afghanistan; article; asylum seeker; biometry; decision making; Denmark; human; immigration; interview; medical assessment; violence",,,,,,,,,,,,"Dahler, N.",,"SAGE Publications Ltd",03063968,,,,"English","Race Cl.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085624522

Alterity processing refers to the data infrastructures, knowledge practices, and bureaucratic procedures through which populations unknown to European actors are translated into “European-legible” identities. By drawing on fieldwork conducted in Italy and the Hellenic Republic from 2017 to 2018, this article argues that different registration and identification procedures compete to legitimize different chains of actors, data, and metadata as more authoritative than others. Competing procedures have governance implications, as well, with some actors being included and others being excluded. Furthermore, there is evidence that—despite procedural rigidities—applicants themselves propose alternative chains of actors, data, and metadata that are more meaningful to them. In this tension, it is not only the individual Other that is enacted but also specific bureaucratic orders cutting across old and new European actors and distinctive understandings of “Europe.” From a technology studies perspective, this article engages in a dialogue with the emergent debate on Hotspots, the scholarship about the infrastructural construction of Europe and political sociology. © The Author(s) 2019.","bureaucracy; data infrastructures; Europe; metadata; migration; population",,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 714463; European Research Council, ERC","A first elaboration of this article?s framework was drafted while the author was a fellow at the Paris Institute for Advanced Studies.

They are the most advanced form of information exchange, conferring direct information access to competent authorities. Interoperable information systems are intended for the exchange of raw material for investigation purposes, which at a later stage could become evidence at trial. Interoperable information systems challenge existing cooperation dynamics and redefine the role of the actors involved. It is questionable whether mutual recognition and approximation, which have been considered the cornerstone of judicial cooperation in both civil and criminal matters for many years, can describe alone integration dynamics in law enforcement cooperation, particularly with reference to information sharing. This article appraises whether, and to what extent, law enforcement access to and use of interoperable information systems constitute new modes of law enforcement cooperation in the EU AFSJ. It then assesses what would be the implications of such a paradigm shift on information management.

At the same time, the way in which the ongoing interoperability initiatives regarding the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ) databases may influence Europol’s international cooperation raises arguably a set of new legal and practical questions that require urgent consideration. This article examines these issues by connecting the Europol-specific legal framework and international practice to the recently adopted AFSJ interoperability regulations as well as to the EU broader data protection framework. It looks more specifically at the balance between data protection/fundamental rights and operational effectiveness throughout Europol’s legal framework and practice of international cooperation and examines the implications of interoperability of AFSJ databases on this. On the one hand, interoperability of AFSJ databases is likely to boost Europol as an information hub through extended personal data collection and data processing possibilities, thereby making the Agency more attractive to international partners. On the other hand, the possibility to transfer such data outside the EU requires strong and effective safeguards from a data protection perspective. The article tentatively concludes that Europol’s current legal and practical framework for international cooperation seems to tilt the balance on the side of operational effectiveness to the detriment of data protection and fundamental rights, and that the new possibilities offered by the interoperability of AFSJ databases will further enhance this trend. © 2020 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands","AFSJ databases; data protection; effective police cooperation; Europol; fundamental rights; international cooperation; interoperability",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Coman-Kund, F.; Erasmus School of Law, Netherlands; email: comankund@law.eur.nl",,"Kluwer Law International",13543725,,,,"English","European Public Law",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099531525

It argues that recent migration flows augmented pre-existing dynamics of growing reliance upon technology in EU border management. These dynamics are assessed through a study of the way emerging technologies, in particular Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV, commonly known as drones), and specific information and surveillance technologies installed on them, have become increasingly understood as crucial for the management of migration into the EU. The article synthesises securitisation theory with Science and Technology Studies to show, first, how the values reflected in border technologies often encapsulate a securitised understanding of the migrant, and second, how the migrants arriving in Europe have been characterised as both potential security threats and as individuals in need of rescue and protection. These frames trigger securitisation dynamics that portray the migration issue as amenable to state-of-the-art technology. In this logic, security ‘problems’ and security ‘solutions’ are co-produced within a complex multi-layered network of public and private actors. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","border management; drones; European Union; expertise; securitisation; Technology",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Oliveira Martins, B.; Peace Research Institute OsloNorway; email: brumar@prio.org",,"Routledge",1369183X,,,,"English","J.

It sets out features of contemporary migration control practices and their legal governance that contribute to this phenomenon, namely the exceptional treatment of migration in international law; the limited scope of international refugee law; and the pervasive use of externalized, delegated migration controls, in particular by the EU and its Member States. The roots of the current condition are traced back to the containment practices that emerged at the end of the Cold War, with the 2015 ""crisis""framed both as an illustration of the failures of containment, and a source of further stasis. Following an overview of the contributions that make up the Special Issue, this Article identifies five emergent themes, and suggests further lines of inquiry. These are: the promise and limits of strategic human rights limitations; the role of both international criminal law, and domestic (and regional) tort law in securing accountability; the turn to positive obligations to challenge entrenched features of containment; and the role of direct action in support of and solidarity with those challenging migration controls most directly, refugees and migrants themselves. Rather than offering panaceas, the Article concludes with the identification of further new challenges, notably the role of new technologies in further dissipating lines of accountability for decisions to exclude. © The Author(s) 2020.","Human rights; International law; Litigation; Migration; Refugees",,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 716968","hosted by the Refugee Studies Centre at the University of Oxford in November 2018, supported by the RefMig ERC project.

The entry ban entails that a non-citizen expelled from one member state is barred from returning to the whole Schengen area for up to five years, or longer in case of a threat to public policy or national security. The pan-European validity of the entry ban is ensured by an alert entered in the Schengen Information System (SIS). The alert is a set of personal data registered in the SIS which states may process to identify the person with a view of the refusal of entry. Processing personal data of non-citizens may pose a challenge to the protection of their data. The article assesses data protection rules laid down in the SIS Regulation (Regulation 1987/2006) and the Regulation which will replace it (Regulation 2018/1861). As it argues, SIS-specific data protection safeguards are frequently narrower than rules under data protection law, including the General Data Protection Regulation and Council of Europe Convention 108, and fall short of requirements flowing from the right to privacy under the European Convention of Human Rights and EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Data protection; entry ban; Returns Directive; right to privacy; Schengen Information System (SIS)",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Majcher, I.; European Council on Refugees and Exiles (ECRE)Belgium; email: izabella.majcher@graduateinstitute.ch",,"Routledge",1369183X,,,,"English","J.

Turkey’s south-eastern border with Syria has been continuously upgraded with walls and fences incorporating advanced security technology. The border with Greece has witnessed a similar bordering process particularly under pressure from the European Union. Drawing on critical border studies and adopting a Foucauldian lens, this article explores these bordering processes, taking security technology as a heterogonous ensemble of practices that consists of discourses, regulations, institutions, threat perceptions, scientific knowledge etc. Finally, the article comes to two important conclusions. First, it suggests that the detection, filtering and prevention of ‘illegal’ border crossings, smuggling and terrorism are the key reasons advanced for the adoption of technologically intensive border control practices. On the other hand, a more ‘humanitarian discourse’, namely ‘saving the lives of migrants’ is also at play. Second, these security technologies are now increasingly embodied in practices of ‘inclusion’/‘exclusion’ that distinguish ‘risky’ (i.e. illegitimate) from ‘safe’ (i.e. legitimate) mobilities and that create spaces where inequality and injustice are experienced. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","biopolitics; Bordering processes; critical border studies; technology; Turkey",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Koca, B.T.; Institute of Urban and Regional Planning (ISR), Germany; email: togralkoca@tu-berlin.de",,"Routledge",1369183X,,,,"English","J.

It also looks at how a founding member of the EU, France, and an associated country, Switzerland, utilise these European instruments to deport foreigners by focusing on the Dublin III Regulation as well as the Eurodac database, jointly referred to as the Dublin System. Grounding on a comparative study combining documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews and participant observation, this article describes the similarities and differences in the use of the Dublin System in these two countries. Moreover, it also reveals these countries’ specificities with regard to the roles played by local and national administrative bodies, and associative actors.

EU laws and Schengen regulations support states’ implementation of high-tech methods in migration governance and police work. Our fieldwork, conducted with several police units in France and Romania, indicates a gap between the claimed ‘controlled’ management of mobility through crimmigration and the actual messiness at the Schengen border as a result of policy implementation limitations (lack of legislative adjustment to digital demands), poor administration (training of border agents, allocating resources) and political decisions (harmonisation or competing narratives). Despite the promotion of cutting-edge technologies in the deportation process, traditional techniques as well as paperwork remain relevant. This raises questions regarding the articulations of traditional techniques with highly promoted control technologies. While the latter has modified the functioning of the deportation process, these changes do not necessarily make the former useless. In practice, this work is left to the discretion of police officers and ground-level bureaucrats who interpret, create and enforce norms and regulations in the name of ‘the rule of law’. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","borders; citizenship; Digital technologies; migration; Schengen",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Vrăbiescu, I.; WIRL-COFUND Fellow, United Kingdom; email: ioana.vrabiescu@warwick.ac.uk",,"Routledge",1369183X,,,,"English","J.

In recent years, scholars in social sciences and humanities have shown the continuities of colonialism and racism in the politics of biometric identification. Not only are the origins of biometrics closely related to colonial governance and scientific racism, but contemporary biometric technologies also continue to carry on colonial and racial dimensions in their infrastructures and operations. Inspired by Quijano’s notion of ‘coloniality of power’ and departing from existing social and cultural studies of biometrics, the article explores how biometrics is used for the racial classification of people, the (re)production of colonial structures and subject-object relations during and after colonialism. The article focuses on the case of fingerprinting border controls and surveillance in post-imperial Japan. This particular case geographically expands the literature on the relationship between biometrics and colonialism, which has been largely centred upon European and North American contexts. It also helps to understand how one mode of racialization through biometrics is replaced by another, which empowers a new form of racial governance. Drawing on my analysis of the postwar Japanese fingerprinting system, I suggest that it is important to register different forms of racialization through biometrics as there are different forms of racialized control in different historical and geographical contexts. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Biometrics; borders; colonialism; coloniality; Japan; racialization",,"University of Warwick; Suomen Akatemia: 307348, 321755","The preliminary research was funded by an East Asia Postgraduate Fellowship from the Department of Politics and International Studies at the University of Warwick.

In this introduction biometric identification (or IDentification) is presented as a relatively new area of investigation that has been subjected to little ethnographic scrutiny. It is argued that, while biometric technologies are promoted as enabling objective and incontestable IDentification of individuals, they are in practice embedded in specific social contexts, fraught with ambiguity and uncertainty, and dependent on substantial human interpretation and social identification. They are therefore of considerable interest and concern to anthropology. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Biometric technologies; border control; Europe; identity; migration",,"Velux Fonden: 10351","This work was supported by Velux Fonden [grant number 10351].

This paper examines the Mediterranean as a transidiomatic environment: a multilingual space shaped by the communicative practices of groups of people, either territorially defined or deterritorialized, who interact using an array of both face-to-face and long-distance media. These interactions are activated by two sets of opposing players: those involved in border reinforcement and those engaged in border crossing. Transidiomatic practices, in the form of either order-words or passwords, provide an effective angle for the analysis of the intense conflicts and struggles that today fill the Mediterranean borderscape. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","communication; Mediterranean; migration; power; Transidioma",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Jacquemet, M.; Communication Studies, United States; email: mjacquemet@usfca.edu",,"Routledge",02757206,,,,"English","Hist.

From Big Data predictions about population movements in the Mediterranean, to Canada’s use of automated decision-making in immigration and refugee applications, to artificialintelligence lie detectors deployed at European borders, States are keen to explore the use of new technologies, yet often fail to take into account profound human rights ramifications and real impacts on human lives. These technologies are largely unregulated, developed and deployed in opaque spaces with little oversight and accountability. This paper examines how technologies used in the management of migration impinge on human rights with little international regulation, arguing that this lack of regulation is deliberate, as States single out the migrant population as a viable testing ground for new technologies. Making migrants more trackable and intelligible justifies the use of more technology and data collection under the guise of national security, or even under tropes of humanitarianism and development. The way that technology operates is a useful lens that highlights State practices, democracy, notions of power, and accountability. Technology is not inherently democratic and human rights impacts are particularly important to consider in humanitarian and forced migration contexts. An international human rights law framework is particularly useful for codifying and recognising potential harms, because technology and its development is inherently global and transnational. More oversight and issue-specific accountability mechanisms are needed to safeguard fundamental rights of migrants such as freedom from discrimination, privacy rights and procedural justice safeguards such as the right to a fair decision-maker and the rights of appeal. © 2019 The Author.","Artificial intelligence; Global governance; International human rights law; Migration; Migration management; New technologies",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Molnar, P.; University of TorontoCanada",,"Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd.",23989173,,,,"English","Cambridge Int.

In contrast to the indifference or outright hostility with which migrants and refugees have often been treated, a well-intentioned but Eurocentric trope, evident in Ode to Lesvos, is the attempt made by ‘ordinary’ citizens to offer hospitality to those arriving at the continent’s borders. On the other hand, Les Sauteurs (Those Who Jump) presents migrants’ own actions as in part a form of political resistance. Finally, I consider how Gianfranco Rosi’s Fuocoammare (Fire at Sea) and Thomas Østbye’s Imagining Emanuel interrogate the scrutiny, discipline and control endured by asylum seekers and migrants, processes that form part of the unmarked and unremarked upon Žižekian ‘objective violence’ that sustains the European system. These documentaries also offer reminders of the common technologies and routine procedures shared by filmmakers and the modern state’s legal apparatus, as both test veracity and attempt to produce the human subject as knowable. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","documentary; fortress Europe; migrants; Refugees",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Austin, T.; University of SussexUnited Kingdom; email: t.r.austin@sussex.ac.uk",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",17411548,,,,"English","Stud.

Based on this conceptualization, we explore to what extent and under which conditions deliberation is likely to occur in intergovernmental settings. To that end, we analyse decision-making on the proposal to give law enforcement authorities access to the Visa Information System. We conclude that a ‘thicker’ conceptualization yields relatively few instances of deliberation.

Our case study is situated in Romania. Whereas “the Roma” do not exist as a category in the Romanian national registry of citizens, mainstream public discourses regarding “Roma migration” have significantly proliferated over the past decades. Yet, how do authorities come to know “the Roma” and how do they render groups of citizens into racialized populations? We examine two bureaucratic practices in Romania, the census and the registry of citizens, and show how the latter is enacted through various “technologies of vision.” We focus on the category of “the Roma” as a material semiotic configuration enacted by various “data” regarding issues such as territorial segregation, phenotypic appearance, smell, and dialect. Situated at the intersection of Border and Surveillance Studies, Romani Studies, and Science and Technologies Studies, this paper contributes to debates about how “the Roma” are rendered visible in practices of identification and migration management in Europe. © The Author(s) 2019.","border management; Europe; mobility; Racialization; Roma; technologies of vision","border region; bureaucracy; ethnic minority; ethnicity; mobility; policy approach; population migration; racial identity; Europe","European Research Council, ERC","We would like to thank the Romanian Ministry of Administration and Interior for granting a research permit, and the employees of the Department of ?The Evidence of People and Administration of Databases? for hosting one of us during the fieldwork.

By developing an analytic lens of logistics, it outlines a specific mode of infrastructuring which aligns staff from different organizations with databases, devices, and migrants all in one place and organizes mundane practices such as filling out forms, taking fingerprints, signing, and entering datasets along a chain. That way the hotspot is able to locate, sort, and detain those who arrive at the hardened EU border and to create a data infrastructure for controlling, monitoring, and governing further movement by processing data through the bureaucratic channels of the EU’s transnational control assemblages. © The Author(s) 2019.","Actor-Network Theory; border; control; data; infrastructure; logistics; migration","actor network theory; border region; bureaucracy; European Union; infrastructure planning; migration; territorial management; Greece; Moria","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Without much public debate, healthcare and social welfare policies have become part of migration management policies. In the following, I explore new ways of understanding the relationship between borders, healthcare and the management of migrants in the welfare state of Norway. The article draws on fieldwork with migrants who have been irregularised after their asylum applications were rejected. I introduce the concept of ‘intimate borders’ to call attention to how irregular migrants are managed in the encounters between migrants and frontline bureaucrats such as healthcare workers. In these encounters, the legal status of the person becomes an ordering mode, and the potential disease to be treated becomes a subordinate object of concern.

A vast infrastructure supports its visualization, making migration visible and actionable. Recent scholarship on the visuality of migration has clearly shown how visualizing migration is an integral part of governing it. Concepts and research approaches from Science and Technology Studies (STS) are particularly appropriate when studying these connections between knowing and doing. In this paper, the performativity of visual methods and their data practices are analysed with respect to the monitoring infrastructure of European border management. Three such methods – patrolling, recording and publicizing – are reconstructed through analysis of their histories and their present. Patrolling involves the tactical domination of terrains. Recording involves the production of documentary objectivity. Publicizing involves the pictorial capture of fleeting realities. These methods are irreducibly political. Their political significance is explored through the concept of demonstrative effects that helps to show how methods of visualising migration at once involve specific demonstrations of the European association that is operative in them. These demonstrations make visible what Europe can and cannot do. The so-called ‘migration crisis’ of Europe turns out to be more than political discourse but entangled with the very methods that render migration apparent and governable. © The Author(s) 2018.","borders; demonstration; Europe; Migration monitoring; performativity; visuality","border region; conceptual framework; migration; monitoring; political discourse; popular protest; Europe","FP7 Ideas: European Research Council, IDEAS-ERC; European Commission, EC; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7","Above all, I would like to thank the people of Chios and Ermioni Frezouli in particular.

Summary tables provide information on legislative proposals considered in the 115th and 116th Congresses. Various legislative proposals have reflected a range of congressional perspectives and priorities, including with regard to • the authorization of the activities of the U.S. Armed Forces related to the conflict; • the extent of U.S. logistical, material, advisory, and intelligence support for the coalition led by Saudi Arabia; • the approval, disapproval, or conditioning of U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia; • the appropriation of funds for U.S. operations in support of the Saudi-led coalition; • the conduct of the Saudi-led coalition's air campaign and its adherence to international humanitarian law and the laws of armed conflict; • the demand for greater humanitarian access to Yemen; • the call for a wider government assessment of U.S. policy toward Yemen and U.S. support to parties to the conflict; • the nature and extent of U.S.-Saudi counterterrorism and border security cooperation; and • the role of Iran in supplying missile technology and other weapons to the forces of the Houthi movement. The 116th Congress may continue to debate U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition and Saudi Arabia's conduct of the war in Yemen, where fighting has continued since March 2015. The war has exacerbated a humanitarian crisis in Yemen that began in 2011; presently, the World Food Program reports that 20 million Yemenis face hunger in the absence of sustained food assistance. The difficulty of accessing certain areas of Yemen has made it hard for governments and aid agencies to count the war's casualties. Data collected by the U.S. and European-funded Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project (ACLED) suggest that 60,000 Yemenis have been killed since January 2016. The Trump Administration has opposed various congressional proposals, including initiatives to reject or condition proposed U.S. arms sales or to require an end to U.S. military support to Saudi-led coalition operations in Yemen.

How did civil society actors coordinate their responses when national, regional, and global governance failed? This article begins by describing how civil society actors improvised their response through everyday coordination mechanisms defined as the informal processes for communication and decision making that make up the day-to-day action of implementation. Second, the article analyzes four examples of everyday coordination mechanisms: new technologies (like Facebook groups and Whatsapp chats), peer-to-peer refugee coordination, maps of services, and field-level working groups. Everyday coordination threatened state authority because it governed actors in a different way, created parallel systems, and sometimes promoted competing goals. The Greek government responded by institutionalizing, coopting, and cracking down on civil society actors helping refugees. © The Author(s) (2019).

The UAVs have become applicable in civilian, military and across industries circumstances like remote sensing, mapping, traffic monitoring, storm tracking and forecasting, precision crop monitoring, aerial photography, unmanned cargo transport, law enforcement and border control surveillance, search and rescue, etc. In this context, the use of UAV for border protection is one of particular importance to the State of Libya from illegal immigrant and smuggling of the weapons. Libya geographical position, considered a transit point to Europe and lack off the security stability in recent years. Moreover, the length of the Libya border and the difficulty of the geographical terrain especially the Sahara in the south make it difficult for the Border Guard to monitor the border. The use of UAV is the best way to protect the borders, which has several advantages, notably cheap cost, suitable for desert climate, the quality of images taken by UAVs, with high.

Cultural Studies have been crucial in revealing how everyday, particularly media-oriented practices, make and unmake this ‘Fortress’. Yet, until now, the focus has been mostly on how migrants use or are represented through media discourses and technologies. This introduction essay argues that the signifier ‘Fortress Europe’—and its central premise of restraining mobility for some in order to enable freedom for others—also gains meaning in and through socio-cultural practices that we may not (as) immediately associate with the physical crossing of European borders. Particular practices that are discussed in this introduction and examined in the seven original articles of the special issue are: public opinion research, the public mobilization of emotions, negotiating identity in an ‘ancestral homeland’, the consumption of (sports) media, the production of a radio talk show and film archives, as well as the activist use of social media. Broadening scholarly attention to these kinds of sociocultural practices provides an important addition to understanding how power operates across social spheres and discursive orders. In addition, their identification also offers valuable opportunities to understand how and why some practices are particularly pertinent or effective in cementing or destabilizing Fortress Europe. This line of inquiry is visible throughout this special issue, despite the diversity of theoretical frameworks and empirical sites used in the contributing articles. © The Author(s) 2019.","borders; Cultural studies; discourse; Europe; liberal paradox; racism; social exclusion; socio-cultural practices",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Engelbert, J.; Erasmus University RotterdamNetherlands; email: engelbert@eshcc.eur.nl",,"SAGE Publications Ltd",13675494,,,,"English","Eur.

The authors reveal the issues of using the Internet as a tool of the loyal border management of the united countries, ensuring the liberalization of the movement of factors of production through the creation of a single space of freedom, security and justice. The infocommunication technologies are researched as a management mechanism with regard to their influence on modern geopolitical, economic, and specifically industrial processes. The indicated approach is implemented simultaneously both as the management of the content of political relations and the management of their form. The Schengen border management information system is regarded as one of the most striking examples of the information technologies use in the political, economic, and specifically industrial sphere. The structure and legal mechanisms of this system operation are analyzed, on the basis of which the advantages and disadvantages of technological and legal nature are revealed. Special attention is paid to the analysis of the draft laws under development aimed at the improvement of the Schengen information system as an electronic technology for the automated border management of the pan-European space of freedom, security and justice. Among other things the authors have taken into account the latest changes in the legal regulation of the Schengen information system, which took place in October 2018.Taking into account the identified shortcomings in the functioning of the Schengen information system, the recommendations for their elimination are formulated. It is concluded that it is necessary to create a single European information portal in order to optimize the processing of data received from the different agencies. The general trends of the SIS II reform are the simplification and acceleration of the procedures, as well as the strengthening of the personal data protection. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Industrial economics; Information use; Security of data; Business management; Electronic technologies; Factors of production; Industrial processs; Information and Communication Technologies; Information portals; Management mechanisms; Security and justices; Information management",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Shamne N.L.Malushko E.Y.","Institute of Physics Publishing",17578981,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

The recent emergencies related to immigration revealed the substantial inefficiency of conventional means of border patrolling based on warships, coast guard speedboats and helicopters. A reliable technical answer to these emergency problems may come from the use of different kinds of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These flying vehicles may allow at improving border control. Nevertheless, such technologies require significant amount of personnel, energy and infrastructure to properly serve border protection. In order to be really effective, UAVs should autonomously cooperate in networked manner, collecting information from the on-ground and/or water-surface sensors, exchanging data among them and conveying the critical information to remote border control centres. This is the main objective of DAVOSS project (Dynamic Architectures based on UAVs Monitoring for border Security and Safety), funded by NATO in the framework of the Science for Peace and Security Programme. This paper aims at presenting the novel adaptive and virtualized aerospace network architecture proposed in DAVOSS. The leading concepts of DAVOSS are flexibility, dynamic reconfigurability, energy efficiency and broadband connection availability also in critical application scenarios. In order to improve robustness and resilience of the avionic network and to enable the efficient information backhaul also in absence of terrestrial links, advanced networking and communications technologies like Software-Defined Networking (SDN), network slicing and virtualization are introduced. System requirements, coming from potential end-users, along with real application scenarios will be carefully analyzed in order to drive the architectural design phase, whose preliminary outcomes will be shown in the paper. Preliminary results demonstrate the effectiveness of the adoption of virtualization techniques for the considered aerospace network architecture in terms of reduced power consumption at the drone side, with an observed tradeoff with latency. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Antennas; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Flight control systems; Memory architecture; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Virtual reality; Virtualization; Warships; Broadband connection; Critical applications; Dynamic architecture; Dynamic reconfigurability; Networking and communication; Reduced power consumption; Software defined networking (SDN); Virtualization Techniques; Network architecture","SPS G5428; North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO; European Commission, EC","This work has been partially funded by NATO Science for Peace and Security (SPS) Programme, in the framework of the project SPS G5428 ”Dynamic Architecture based on UAVs Monitoring for Border Security and Safety”.","Riccardo Bassoli received his B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Telecommunications Engineering from University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (Italy) in 2008 and 2010 respectively.

Since its establishment, the Schengen Visa has been an extraordinary example of the success of a borderless region and led to vibrant in growth and social development. ASEAN, as a new economic community that tries to set itself as a beneficiary of the lessons learned from the European Union, has been struggling in establishing its own common visa region. The reasons encompass economic, political, and social-cultural concerns. This study focuses specifically on the Lao PDR and it aims to assess the preparedness of the country if the region were to establish the common visa system. The study employs a qualitative approach and collects data via an interview questionnaire. Research data are collected from interviews of six high-ranking government officials. Using the theme generating and data coding approach in ATLAS, a qualitative data analysis program, this study found that the preparedness of the Lao PDR in implementing the ASEAN Common Visa (ACV) spans nine key factors: (1) geographical location, (2) visa policy, (3) immigration control, (4) quota of foreign workers in the private sector, (5) information and communications technology (ICT) in connectivity development, (6) electronic systems in the consular sector, (7) infrastructure, (8) population mobility, and (9) attitudes towards the ACV. After categorizing these factors based on economic, political, and social-cultural dimensions, it was found that population mobility is a common concern among the three dimensions. This suggests that the Lao PDR needs to focus on improvements in border management, synchronization of information and communication technology, infrastructure, and human resources development among the relevant sectors. © 2020 Sciedu Press.","ASEAN; Common visa; Economic; Lao PDR; Political-security; Social-cultural",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kang, E.; Saint Mary's University of MinnesotaUnited States; email: exkang14@smumn.edu",,"Sciedu Press",19233981,,,,"English","Res.

Drawing from the tension between the EU’s attempt to achieve watertight border controls by means of biometric technologies, and migrants’ persistence to move to and live in the EU, the volume pursues two interrelated objectives: first, it studies the encounters between migrants and the Visa Information System (VIS), one of the largest biometric databases in the world, from the perspective of mobility in order to investigate how migrants appropriate mobility via Schengen visa within and against this biometric border regime. Second, it addresses criticisms of autonomy of migration in order to develop it as a viable approach for border, migration and critical security studies. Hence, the book is driven by two interrelated research questions: what does the assertion of moments of autonomy of migration refer to in the context of border regimes that use biometrics to turn migrants’ bodies into a means of mobility control? And how do migrants appropriate mobility via Schengen visa within and against biometric border regimes? This book will be of great interest to scholars in border, migration and critical security studies, as well as researchers engaged in citizenship studies, surveillance studies, political theory, critical IR theory and international political sociology. © 2019 Stephan Scheel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Scheel, S.; Sociology department, Germany",,"Taylor and Francis",,9781351977838; 9781138285361,,,"English","Autonomy of Migration?: Appropriating Mobil. within Biometric Bord.

Especially at airports, automated border control, more commonly known as e-gates, have been taken widely into use. With e-gates, travelers perform border check as self-service, and the role of the border guards is to monitor or possibly also assist travelers passing the border. The introduction of automated systems significantly reshapes current ways of conducting border control from the border guard’s perspective, and automation thus requires new skills from them. Understanding the effects of automation on the work tasks and work performance of border guards requires thorough examination. This paper introduces key Human Factors issues affecting border guard and border control system performance. The results are based on literature review and field studies conducted in different border control points within six European countries. The paper presents a Human Factors framework for understanding the complex nature of the border control and different factors influencing to both border control process and border guard performance within it. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2019.","Automated border control; Border digitalization; EU; Human factors; Human factors framework; Schengen area","Europium; Human engineering; Automated systems; Border control; Border digitalization; Cross-border traffic; European Countries; Literature reviews; Schengen area; Work performance; Automation","Horizon 2020: 653676","Acknowledgements.

But while its effects are well examined in migration and border studies, less is known about the intricate ways in which biometric bordering is politically negotiated and socio-technically put into practice. Therefore, in this paper, I trace the contested emergence of one particular scheme of biometric border control currently in the making: the EU’s Smart Borders Package. Proposed by the European Commission in 2013, it aims at digitally registering all third-country nationals’ entries to and exits from the Schengen area, while simultaneously accelerating the border crossing of certain travellers. I argue that, unlike other forms of biometric bordering, the Smart Borders Package problematises border control primarily on the level of its temporalities and constitutes the speed of border crossings, the timing of control as well as third-country nationals’ duration of stay as distinct objects of governing. Meanwhile, the project’s political negotiations have sparked techno-political controversies that repeatedly brought it to the brink of failure. Yet, these controversies have significantly enhanced the intelligibility and practicability of biometric bordering, contributing to the emergence of what I call the self-service border. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Biometrics; border control; EU smart border; technology; temporality","biometry; border region; European Union; immigration policy; international migration; technology adoption; Europe",,,,,,,,,,,,"Sontowski, S.; Department of Geography, Switzerland; email: simon.sontowski@geo.uzh.ch",,"Routledge",1369183X,,,,"English","J.

This article transposes on-site border malfunctions into the antecedent register of research and development in order to explore how failure operates in the design, construction and testing of a border security technology. Drawing from extensive ethnographic research of a European-wide project to develop the Handhold portable chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive (CBRNE) detector, this article traces how failure is mobilized as an instructive experience in the professional cultures of science, engineering and governance, and retrospectively narrated as a necessary step on the road to eventual success. In exploring the limitations of this understanding, the article demonstrates how competing experiences of failure constantly trouble the daily routines of scientists and engineers, shape informal de-risking strategies, and fuel the relentless pursuit of innovation. To contest the dominant account of failure as an instructive experience, the article argues that more creative and critical research into the heterogeneous life-worlds of failure is needed in order to politicize the consequences of border failures and connect them to the antecedent register of scientific research and development. © The Author(s) 2017.","Borders; failure; innovation; risk; security; technology",,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/K011332/1; Universiteit van Amsterdam, UvA: 02/2015, 09/2014","I would like to thank: the participants of the workshop ?Security/Mobility ?

Many examples of DAQ systems are monolithic processes that run on a computer attached to the DAQ hardware. In this new DAQ, a different process is assigned to each task of the system (e.g. data acquisition, pre-processing, analysis, high-voltage management...). The communication between the processes is obtained through dedicated communication sockets. An important advantage of this approach is the possibility to distribute the system over several computers connected in a network, in order to distribute the computational load. The distributed nature of the system allows also the implementation of on-line data analysis processes that can be computationally intensive. Moreover the system is very versatile, as the different tasks can be dynamically activated or disabled, and robust, since a failure of one of the processes does not jeopardize the whole system. The system has been used in the project to acquire the data generated by fast signal digitizers. Excellent results were obtained, both in terms of performance (e.g. maximum acquisition rates) and stability.

We argue that border security drones have contrary political, policy, and ethical implications. First, the encroachment of military technologies into non-military security operations may have adverse security repercussions, but drones may also save migrants' lives as they make dangerous journeys through deserts and across rough seas. Second, drone surveillance erodes privacy but also creates new accountability mechanisms. Finally, drones may obviate some visible signs of security, such as fences, while also introducing an invisible security apparatus that extends beyond state boundaries. These contradictory effects help to explain the complex policy formation processes underlying drone border security programs in the United States and Europe, as well as the challenge of reaching clear answers about whether drone security is desirable. © The Author(s) (2018).

Afirmamos que los drones destinados a la vigilancia de las fronteras tienen implicaciones políticas, éticas y reglamentarias opuestas. En primer lugar, la intrusión de las tecnologías militares en las operaciones de seguridad no militares puede tener repercusiones negativas en materia de seguridad, pero al mismo tiempo, los drones pueden salvar las vidas de los inmigrantes que emprenden un peligroso viaje en el que cruzan desiertos y mares embravecidos. En segundo lugar, la vigilancia con drones reduce la privacidad, pero también permite crear nuevos mecanismos de responsabilidad. Por último, los drones pueden pasar por alto señales visibles de seguridad, como las vallas, a la vez que introducen un sistema de vigilancia invisible que va más allá de las fronteras nacionales.

Through a case study of Spain's SIVE (Sistema Integrado de Vigilancia del Exterior) surveillance system, I tease apart the Guardia Civil's technocratic claims of omni-voyance by focusing on the daily interactions between border guards, vision technologies, rescue services, Moroccan forces, and the lively materials of the borderspace itself. I employ a literary narrative in order to expose the daily breaches of control as the guards and technologies contend with the non-human elements of the borderspace, as well as their own inability to remain vigilant. Far from offering unbroken control, therefore, I argue that the vision produced through SIVE is stuttered and fragmented through both human and technological flaws. I also draw on assemblage theory in order to trace the disparate actors being drawn into the border regime. I argue that these new actors are only ever partially encountered and incorporated, however, and that as a result the system's ability to incorporate also becomes its Achilles heel. The effect is a geography of the border that foregrounds the ‘little details’ of borderwork and the volatility of the borderspace itself – thus exposing the flaws behind a scopic narrative that claims unceasing vision and an unhindered reach. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,"border region; maritime boundary; political geography; surveillance and enforcement; territorial management; territoriality; theoretical study; Spain",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Elsevier Ltd",09626298,,,,"English","Polit.

Medicine has not been at the core of recent EU-funded efforts in central Europe, partially due to significant differences in health care administration, delivery, reimbursement, and culture. However, impeding changes in social structure and centralization of specialized care warrant changes in preclinical administration of medical care, which are already transforming practices across developed countries in central Europe. Moreover, demographic and social changes are transforming not only patients but also health care providers, thus leading to an increased need for specialized medical personnel, particularly in regions close to formerly secluding borders. The EU-funded cooperation project presented in this article is located in the Euroregion Pomerania, which consists of northeastern Germany and northwestern Poland. This project emerged because of the need to solve practical emergency medicine–related problems for many years, which brought partners together. Unfortunately, administrative and medical interaction has not become significantly easier with Poland joining the Schengen area in 2007 and, subsequently, initial international contracts regarding, among other things, emergency medicine being negotiated and signed thereafter. Three different interdependent areas of cooperation within the project deal with key aspects of an improved and eventually integrated cooperation. An accepted clarification of administrative and legal foundations – or the lack and thus the need thereof – needs to be defined. Specialized language and simulation-based education and practice sessions employing modern technology throughout will be introduced to the entire region. Finally, the pre-existing and developing acceptance and sustainability aspects of personnel involved in the aforementioned actions and stakeholders on both sides of the border will be evaluated. In essence, the project focuses on a multimodal improvement of professional cooperation of key providers of emergency medicine services in the Euroregion Pomerania. Thereby, it aims to improve infrastructure; interpersonal and professional skills of involved personnel, administrative, and cultural relations; and eventually identification of specialized personnel with their workplace and region to secure and retain important medical workforce in an otherwise remote area on both sides of a formerly secluded border. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","emergency medicine; integrated cross-border care; joint language and interprofessional training; paramedic education; simulation environment; sustainable continued education","ambulance; developed country; emergency health service; emergency medicine; Germany; health care delivery; health care management; health care quality; human; interpersonal communication; language development; patient information; Poland; priority journal; reimbursement; Review; rural area; simulation training; vocational education; work environment; workplace; emergency medicine; European Union; forecasting; health care personnel; standards; telemedicine; trends; Delivery of Health Care; Emergency Medicine; European Union; Forecasting; Health Personnel; Humans; Telemedicine; Workforce","U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, VA; European Commission, EC; European Regional Development Fund, FEDER","The project is funded by the European Commission by means of the European Fund for Regional Development (EFRD) , Program Interreg VA .

As part of a securitisation process, these measures are often expanded upon and justified in terms of economic threat that aims to restrain ‘opportunist Central East European migrants’, who are associated with welfare dependence and cheap labour. Although unemployed Roma migrants are exposed to social exclusion due to the stigma of ‘benefit shoppers’, this paper explores how current neoliberal labour market structures facilitate new securitisation processes and fuel the precarity of Roma, even if they are employed in the host country. Based on a multi-sited ethnography completed in The United Kingdom, it will be illustrated how communitarianism of Member States stratifies the moral values of migrants’ labour in a manner that defines the preconditions of social inclusion of newcomers in host societies. In short, this paper argues that even for migrants who are not welfare dependent and who are self-sustaining, their social inclusion is defined by engagement in the sort of labour that is culturally acknowledged by the host society. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.","communitarianism; precarity; securitisation; social sorting",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nagy, V.; Willem Pompe Institute for Criminal Law and Criminology, Netherlands; email: v.nagy@uu.nl",,"SAGE Publications Ltd",02690942,,,,"English","Local Econ.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044534866

Digital migration studies is an emerging interdisciplinary field focussed on studying migration in, through and by means of the internet. As the so-called European refugee crisis demonstrates, the scale, intensities and types of transnational migration and digital networking have drastically changed in recent years. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have fundamentally transformed migration processes and vice versa. Top-down management of migration flows and border control is increasingly dependent on digital technologies and datafication, while from the bottom-up migrants use smart phones and apps to access information, maintain transnational relations, establish local connections and send remittances. In the first half of the chapter, drawing on (Candidatu et al., 2018) we distinguish between three paradigms of digital migration studies: (1) migrants in cyberspace; (2) everyday digital migrant life; (3) migrants as data. In the second half of the chapter, we offer the methodological research principles of relationality, adaptability and ethics-of-care to operationalize digital migration studies with a commitment to social justice. Challenging unjust power relations is important both when studying vulnerable groups as well as studying elites. The many experiences, obstacles and opportunities we found in the literature reveal that the future of digital migration studies lies at the intersection of big and small data, there is great urgency in triangulating quantified patterns with in-depth narrative accounts and situated experiences. © The Author(s) 2018.","Digital Migration; Digital Practices; Emerging Research Focus; European Refugee Crisis; Information And Communication Technologies (ICTs)",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Leurs, K.; Utrecht UniversityNetherlands; email: K.H.A.Leurs@uu.nl",,"Springer Science and Business Media B.V.",23644087,,,,"English","IMISCOE Res.

Over the last two years, in the context of the initiative that led to the adoption of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR) and in some parts of a study commissioned by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) on the use of certain investigative tools by Law Enforcement agencies, data protection has been in the center of the legal debate. The GDPR places the person in the core of its protection system, and protects the individuals through the protection of their data. The LIBE Commission study, while moving from a different point of view more connected to the protection of civil rights during investigations, evaluates, at some point, the risks of individual's data processing without proper guarantees.

The EU visa policy has two key areas: the establishment of a visa / visa-free entry regime; the establishment of the procedure and conditions for issuing short stay visas. The latter area also includes issues related to the functioning of the Visa Information System. Currently, the EU realizes the reform of the visa policy, which covers both its directions. The analysis of the ongoing reform shows that the EU, on the one hand, seeks to strengthen external borders by creating additional control mechanisms, and. on the other hand, as a compensatory measure, creates more comfortable conditions for the entry of frequent and law-abiding travelers. © 2018 Institute of Europe Russian Academy of Sciences.

In this regard, this article examines the EU’s strategy and rationalisations to develop dual-use technologies such as aerial surveillance drones for border management. By drawing on critical security and technology studies and by focusing on their functional technological efficiency, the article argues that drones are being normalised in a technological regime of exclusion at the border-zone. It further contends that high-end technologies such as drones introduce a military bias as security enablers in border surveillance and as a panacea for the consequences of failed policies to manage irregular migration. A closer examination of several EU-endorsed drone projects reveals a pragmatic and industry-driven approach to border security, underlining the evolving homogenisation between internal and external security and the imminent “dronisation” of European borders. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","border security; drones; European Union; FRONTEX; technological efficiency",,"Israel Aerospace Industries, IAI; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7","The author would like to thank Daniel Fiott and the other participants at the EUIA 2018 panel for their helpful feedback.

There is an overt tendency to prioritise high technologies such as drones in border management and the adoption of so-called “robot armies at the EU’s borders” (Hayes ). The EU’s FP7 structural funds for security research have been allocated to defence consortia, including Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), Sagem, Dassault Aviation, Thales, Airbus Group, Bae System, and Finmeccanica (now Leonardo S.p.A.). Rules have generally prohibited defence companies from tapping research grants under the structural funds schemes for the specific funding of military-oriented research projects. The concept of dual-use technologies has managed to circumvent such rules, covering equipment development such as dual-use drone technologies for both civilian and military objectives.

Joel Millman of the International Organization for Migration corroborates that when Syrians arrive in Italy or Greece “they just melt away at the pier-they get on Facebook, and they know where to go”.

We have analyzed the implementation of information security for the EU information systems EURODAC, SIS II and VIS in case of Estonia. The analysis comes in a situation, where there are multiple regulations, directives, guidelines; but it lacks a unified standard for the implementation of the member states subsystems. The main finding is that a separate standard is not necessary; however, there is a need for setting minimum requirements, ensuring security of the information systems, that come with appropriate guidelines that help the member states to achieve the minimum requirements. The second finding is that there is a need for greater cooperation and an increased knowledge exchange of the methods used in the member states. Following defined guidelines and exchanging knowledge would help to strengthen the level of security for the entire system. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2018.","EU-LISA; EURODAC; GDPR; ISO 27001; IT security; Schengen; SIS II; VIS","Electronic commerce; Information use; Knowledge management; Security of data; EURODAC; GDPR; ISO 27001; IT security; Schengen; Information systems",,,,,,,,,,,,"Draheim, D.; Large-Scale Systems Group, Akadeemia tee 15a, Estonia; email: dirk.draheim@ttu.ee","Mantymaki M.Al-Sharhan S.A.Simintiras A.C.Tahat L.Moughrabi I.Ali T.M.Janssen M.Dwivedi Y.K.Rana N.P.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783030021306,,,"English","Lect.

Public and private security breaches as well as terrorist attacks can be directly traced to nefarious actors exploiting these deficiencies. This paper uses the European migrant crisis that began in 2011 and peaked in 2015 to highlight threats, examine issues in the collection and processing of biometric data, and suggest solutions. While biometrics enrolment of asylum seekers is taking place sporadically throughout Europe, policies are not enforced uniformly, allowing migrant obscurity and creating failures in identifying nefarious actors. We explored gaps via the analysis of anonymous databases, news outlets and professional experience in the field. The geographic focus is on Germany and the border free region known as the Schengen Area. The conclusion is that the proper use of biometrics increases security, while ignoring them could lead to catastrophic results. © 2018 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

What the notion of appropriation better captures than concepts like agency or resistance is the multi-faceted and intricate intertwinement of border regimes and migratory practices. The article illustrates this advantage through an analysis of the phenomenon of bezness. The term refers to a migration strategy of aspiring migrants who seduce and subsequently marry European tourists as a way to gain entry to and residency in Europe. This article develops a reading of bezness as a mode of appropriation of mobility which is intertwined with the border regime in at least four ways: First, bezness is provoked by restrictive visa policies that create a highly unequal access to mobility and life opportunities. The case of bezness illustrates, second, that migrants try to recode the methods, logics and effects of mobility control into means of appropriation. Migrants' practices of appropriation involve, third, the clandestine transgression of the norms, rules and regulations that define particular border regimes. Finally, the notion of appropriation permits to recognize that the European border regime operates as an apparatus of capture that tries to recuperate migrants' practices in order to turn them into a driving force for its own development. The example of bezness demonstrates, moreover, that these processes of recuperation also feature the mobilization of emotions-in this case of romantic love-as technologies of government. © The Author 2017.

The ways in which the emerging transnational policies of migration management are actually put into practice and are thereby shaped by implementing actors, as well as the contexts to which they have been applied, have received less attention. Against this background, the article turns to the IOM's contested implementation of migration management in Morocco. As such, it aims to extend the dominant focus of most studies on state and EU institutions, their policy, discourse and decision making towards the border zones in which their practical outcome and meaning is negotiated. Using the example of two projects implemented by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), it reconstructs the negotiation processes of international migration management on the ground. Based on the analysis of emerging control practices in Morocco, the article shows how humanitarian and neoliberal logics of governing migration complement existing security-oriented policies and, as such, contribute to the (re)stabilization and expansion of the trans- Mediterranean migration regime in times of fading legitimacy. With theoretical reference to the concept of a migration regime, the article argues that these reconfigurations are neither the result of a centrally directed 'EUropean masterplan' nor of a linear evolution towards more sophisticated control technologies but the contingent outcome of struggles between migration movements and the political and administrative attempts to control them. © The Author 2017.

Based on an analysis of documents published by EU institutions and independent organizations, I argue that these technological innovations fundamentally alter the nature of national borders. I discuss how new technologies of vision are deployed to transcend the physical limits of territories. In the last twenty years, EU member states and institutions have increasingly relied on various forms of remote tracking, including the use of drones for the purposes of monitoring frontier zones. In combination with other facets of the EU border management regime (such as transnational databases and biometrics), these technologies coalesce into a system of governance that has enabled intervention into neighboring territories and territorial waters of other states to track and target migrants for interception in the “prefrontier.” For jurisdictional reasons, this practice effectively precludes the enforcement of legal human rights obligations, which European states might otherwise have with regard to these persons. This article argues that this technologically mediated expansion of vision has become a key feature of post–cold war governance of borders in Europe. The concept of transterritory is proposed to capture its effects. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","borders; drones; European Union; Eurosur; surveillance",,"Heinrich Böll Stiftung; European Chemical Industry Council, Cefic; European Commission; European Parliament","Building on my own research on European responses to boat disasters on the Mediterranean (Follis 2015) and on the work of others who show how EU border policies exacerbate the migratory crisis (Albahari 2015; Mountz and Loyd 2014; Human Rights Watch [HRW] 2009; Weber and Pickering 2011; Spijkerboer 2007), I ask, how and for whom are jurisdictional boundaries manipulated? What are the legal and political benefits of these shifts and who is hoping to reap them? To answer these questions, I draw on science and technology studies and surveillance studies literature to develop a theoretical account of Eurosur as a system of “situated surveillance” (Gad and Lauritsen 2009). I set it in the context of the post-1989 history of bordering in Europe, as I present evidence from a selection of published statements and reports on its function and projected development.

With effect, from 7 April, a new EU rule (Regulation 2017/458) has reinforced checks against relevant databases at external borders. This makes checking EU citizens and their travel documents against databases compulsory, enhanced with biometric checks where needed. It means that at the border gates, instead of checking EU citizens randomly, they should all be checked. The solutions identified by the project include the pre-arrival registration and the biometric identification of people to speed up the process1 and wearable intelligent border control equip­ment that will allow the capacity for control to be enlarged, even where the infrastructure can­not be physically extended by increasing the head­count of the border control force. The Intelligent Portable Control System pro­ject has led to a series of findings about the best application of different biometric modalities in border control. The project has also explored the issues around introducing these innovations. The imple­mentation process is complex, encompassing not only novel biometric solutions but also related biometric analytics, detection and com­munication tools. Consequently, and based on the results of the end user requirements collection, the project assumes the implementation of a face-matching tool, palm vein scanner, fingerprint recognition and an automatic deception detection system. Biometric technologies offer a potential solution to deliver high security lev­els while minimising the impact on travellers’ transit time. The proposed Intelligent Portable Control System aims to achieve this, enabling faster and more thorough border control for third-country nationals crossing the land borders of EU member states.",,"Control systems; Pattern recognition; Biometric checks; Biometric identifications; Biometric technology; Deception detection; End user requirements; Fingerprint Recognition; Terrorist threats; Travel documents; Biometrics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Elsevier B.V.",09694765,,,,"English","Biom.

This article engages with what we call the ‘operative vision’ of surveillance at sea, specifically as performed by the border control apparatus in the Aegean. We analyse the political consequences of this operative vision by elaborating on three examples of fieldwork conducted in the Aegean and on the islands of Chios and Lesbos. One of the main aims is to bring the figure of the migrant back into the study of border technologies. By combining insights from science and technology studies with border, mobility and security studies, the article distinguishes between processes of intervention, mobilization and realization and emphasizes the role of migrants in their encounter with surveillance operations. Two claims are brought forward. First, engaging with recent scholarly work on the visual politics of border surveillance, we circumscribe an ongoing ‘transactional politics’. Second, the dynamic interplay between vision and action brings about a situation of ‘recalcitrance’, in which mobile objects and subjects of various kinds are drawn into securitized relations, for instance in encounters between coast guard boats and migrant boats at sea. Without reducing migrants to epiphenomena of those relations, this recalcitrance typifies the objects of surveillance as both relatable as well as resistant, particularly in the tensions between border control and search and rescue. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Aegean; border surveillance; irregular migration; politics; visualization",,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7: 283679",,,,,,,,,,,"Dijstelbloem, H.; University of Amsterdam, Oude Turfmarkt 141, Netherlands; email: H.O.Dijstelbloem@uva.nl",,"SAGE Publications Ltd",09670106,,SDIAE,,"English","Secur.

Although both countries have important agreements to promote economic exchange and trade, the events of 9/11 and other acts of terrorism have increased concerns about border security. Since the US-Mexico border is one of the most important borders in the world in terms of activity, securing it without interfering with the legitimate flow of people and goods, poses an important challenge. The purpose of this paper is to propose conceptual frameworks and models to facilitate collaboration across national borders, by discussing and considering key factors for collaborative US-Mexico Border Security Infrastructure and Systems. Border security technical solutions pose an interesting domain because there are a myriad of concerns (e.g., political, economic, social and cultural) outside the technical implementation that must be deliberated and examined. In this conceptual study, unique aspects of trust, governance, information sharing, culture, and technical infrastructure are identified as the key ingredients in a cross-border collaboration effort. A bi-national organizational network appears to be an effective institutional design to develop a better understanding of the problem, as well as required policies and technologies. This approach is consistent with experiments, research, and conclusions found in the European Union. © 2017 by IGI Global.

The main objective of the research and development project 'Automated Comparison of X-ray Images for Cargo Scanning (ACXIS)', which is funded by the European 7th Framework Program, is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the inspection procedures of cargo at customs using X-ray technology. The current inspection procedures are reviewed to identify risks, catalogue illegal cargo, and prioritize detection scenarios. Based on these results, we propose an integrated solution that provides automation, information exchange between customs administrations, and computer-based training modules for customs officers. Automated target recognition (ATR) functions analyze the X-ray image after a scan is made to detect certain types of goods such as cigarettes, weapons and drugs in the freight or container. Other helpful information can also be provided, such as the load homogeneity, total or partial weight, or the number of similar items. The ATR functions are provided as an option to the user. The X-ray image is transformed into a manufacturer-independent format through geometrical and spectral corrections and stored into a database along with the user feedback and other related data. This information can be exchanged with similar systems at other sites, thus facilitating information exchange between customs administrations. The database is seeded with over 30'000 examples of legitimate and illegal goods. These examples are used by the ATR functions through machine learning techniques, which are further strengthened by the information exchange. In order to improve X-ray image interpretation competency of human operators (customs officers), a computer-based training software is developed that simulates these new inspection procedures. A study is carried out to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the computer-based training as well as the implemented procedures. Officers from the Dutch and Swiss Customs administrations partake in the study, covering both land and sea borders. © 2016 IEEE.","automated target recognition; cargo inspection; computer-based training standardization; Customs border control; image; security screening; simulation; X-ray image analysis; X-ray screening","Automation; Computer aided analysis; Containers; Crime; E-learning; Efficiency; Information dissemination; Inspection; Learning systems; Personnel training; Risk perception; X ray analysis; X ray screens; Automated target recognition; Border control; Cargo inspection; Computer - based trainings; image; Security screening; simulation; X-ray image; X-ray screening; Image analysis",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Claycomb W.R.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",10716572,9781509010707,,,"English","Proc.

One critical application domain for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) streaming is border security, mapping and precise agriculture. Regarding the first issue, the current political evolutions in the wide region of south eastern European territory reveals the significance for a wide surveillance. This is also valid in agriculture to get a more precise and high quality production. However, efficient access to video data located on Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAVs) and real-time streaming is an arduous task due to large bandwidth requirements imposed by the video sequences and the unstable capacity and bandwidth of the wireless channel. In addition, the traditional representation of a video sequence as a stream of consecutive frames is not reliable for new emerging applications needed in aerial vehicles such as content indexing, retrieval and non-linear access and browsing. This reveals the need for the implementation of non-linear tools enabling the efficient summarization of the visual content. Summarization refers to the process of creating compact summaries of the Audio-Video (AV) content that facilitate discovery, browsing and navigation of the AV content. In this paper, we propose a fast video summarization algorithm that enables the extraction of key frames from UAV-captured videos. The algorithm exploits the curvature of the magnitude of visual feature trajectory to detect content fluctuations both in time and in space. Experiments on real-life aerial data reveal the efficiency of the proposed schemes. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The analysis draws from a set of thinking tools developed by the sociology of association in the field of science and technology studies. The contribution argues that in order to grasp policy outcomes such as smart borders, security studies would benefit from adopting a compositional outlook on agency, where action is seen as the effect of associated entities. Looking at the smartening of EU borders, the article finds that this process is held together by multiple translations and enrolments through which the technical side of dataveillance – platforms, automated gates, matching systems, and so forth – has become associated with the processes of policymaking on border security and sustains the furtherance of mass dataveillance. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","European Union; smart borders; sociology of association; surveillance; technology",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Jeandesboz, J.; Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Av.

Box 90153, Tilburg, 5000 LE, Netherlands","Record numbers of migrants and refugees fleeing violence and poverty in parts of Africa and the Middle East present the European Union with unprecedented challenges, including in determining their identity as well as status. In recent years problems of identifying immigrants have been addressed in order to fight identity fraud and illegal entry of migrants. As a result, a wide variety of digital systems have been introduced to orchestrate an effective, preventative modus of identification of migrants. Digital systems are in particular geared towards spotting those migrants who (are about to) commit identity fraud or who enter the territory of EU member states illegally. Although the key aim of the digital systems is framed to protect the administrative, geographic and legal borders of the member state and the safety of its population, empirically based studies demonstrate that these systems bring new risks for migrants themselves. This article intends to contribute to the discussion on the use of digital systems for managing the movement of migrants by analysing identification and risk assessment systems from the perspective of the new European data protection regime and the European Convention on Human Rights. For this purpose, two identification systems - the so-called INS console within the Dutch immigration and border sector, and the PROGIS console within the law enforcement sector - are analysed. A third is the Advanced Passenger Information system operated at Schiphol Airport by border control and immigration services. Against the background of the position of many migrants finding themselves at risk in their home country and of the two legislative frameworks mentioned above, this article addresses two issues. First, the analysis focuses on how migrants are perceived by digital monitoring practices: are they themselves at risk, non-risk or do they pose a risk? In the EU, migrants must prove that their case is worthy of asylum status because they are 'at risk' from political unrest or other life-threatening circumstances in their home country. Yet, empirical data gathered through semi-structured interviews show that simply abiding by the standards during an enrolment process of the INS console, rather than being 'at risk', a migrant can easily be categorised as 'posing a risk' (La Fors-Owczynik & Van der Ploeg, 2015). Second, this article aims to investigate what the capacity of the new data protection regime is in protecting migrants from being framed as 'a risk' or a 'misfit' stemming from the use of digital systems. Given this second aim, the following discussion also intends to explore the extent to which the European Convention on Human Rights can provide an additional legal remedy for migrants being digitally categorised in a manner that is detrimental to them. © 2016 Karolina La Fors-Owczynik.","Biometrics; Border control; Data protection; Human rights; Identification; Immigration; Law enforcement; Migrants; Profiling; Risk","Air navigation; Biometrics; Crime; Data privacy; Identification (control systems); Law enforcement; Laws and legislation; Risks; Social aspects; Border control; Human rights; Immigration; Migrants; Profiling; Risk assessment","European Research Council, ERC; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7: 201853","This article is based on research conducted during the DigIDeas project.

For this reason, discussions on developing the legislative framework governing these matters are highly sensitive and subject to ethical controversy. At a European level there are numerous ethical challenges related to assisted reproductive technology (ART) but none related into uniform manner to be acceptable by all member countries. Methods: In this respect, we review the current legislation of the following twenty-six European countries which are also into Shengen Area: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweeden, Switzerland, other four European countries that do not form part of the Schengen Area, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania and other two like Ireland and the United Kingdom. Results: Twenty-four of the European Union member states (i.e. Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweeden, Switzerland, Bulgaria, Croatia and United Kingdom) have reported the existence of specific legislation, while 8 countries (i.e. Cyprus, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Poland, Romania, Latvia) have reported that no specific legislation exists, only general legislation covering ART procedures. Conclusions: We propose that legal systems should supplement the existing laws and adapt it to the unique challenges presented by ART, so that society may benefit from the application of ART advancement in a socially responsible and uniform ethical manner. © 2016 Romanian Society of Ultrasonography in Obstetrics and Gynecology.","Assisted reproduction; Ethical aspects; Europe; Research","Article; assisted reproductive technology; consensus development; cryopreservation; economic aspect; Europe; health care policy; human; infertility; law; legal aspect; medical ethics; medical research; nidation; reproduction; reproductive health; sperm donor",,,,,,,,,,,,"Hangan, T.L.; Faculty of Medicine, Romania; email: tonyhangan@yahoo.com",,"Versa Puls media Network",23442379,,,,"English","Gineco.eu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84974569625

However, it is precisely the technology deployed at the borders which paradoxically pushes illegalized travelers to zones of greater exposure to “nature.” The article explores from a cultural-sociological perspective the new configurations of technology, “culture,” and “nature” that are emerging through the EU border regime. Drawing on Agamben's category of bare life, it claims that illegalized travelers are displaced into a sphere of mere biological survival. A content and discourse analysis of the narratives attached to technological products developed for border surveillance and control reveals a symbolical construction of the illegalized traveler as contiguous to “nature” while technology is depicted as if deprived of agency. Technology and nature are often perceived as neutral, ahistorical, and value-free, but are always socially and historically constructed. This construction expresses a certain understanding of the border scenario and an underlying definition of what is “human.” The paradox between the humanitarian and the securitization paradigms is thus only apparent: both rely on the construction of the illegalized travelers as bare life. A global biopolitical schism along the boundary between “nature” and “culture”—analogous to what Latour called the “great divide” between “moderns” and “others”—is being reproduced but also disputed and negotiated along the EU borders. © 2016 Association for Borderlands Studies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Schindel, E.; Center of Excellence Cultural Foundations of Social Integration, Universitätstr. 10, Germany; email: estela.schindel@uni-konstanz.de",,"Routledge",08865655,,,,"English","J.

This intensification in irregular migration has led to the design and application of a migration control policy whose instrumental and institutional structures are becoming increasingly complex. Irregular immigration at maritime borders has been addressed through what we have referred to and characterized as a multi-layered deterrence strategy which has been gradually implemented and upgraded along the main entry points and migration corridors. The Spanish strategy is tightly intertwined with the unfolding of the EU Integrated Border Management approach and combines higher inputs of surveillance and border control technologies with multilateral cooperation agreements reached with transit and origin countries. High-tech border surveillance increases interception probabilities, but effective migration deterrence is conditioned by high expulsion rates once the border has been crossed. It is in the task of border implementation that technology appears as one of the pillars of the control structure and where its effect on deterrence depends on its embeddedness in a mix of instruments and actions. © 2016 Association for Borderlands Studies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Godenau, D.; Tenured Lecturer, Camino de la Hornera s/n, Spain; email: dgodenau@ull.es",,"Routledge",08865655,,,,"English","J.

In contrast to claims of waning state sovereignty, drawing on detailed case studies from the United States and European Union, we argue the militarisation of borders represents a re-articulation and expansion of state sovereignty into new spaces and arenas. We argue that the nexus of military-security contractors, dramatically increased security budgets, and the discourse of threats from terrorism and immigration is resulting in a profound shift in border security. The construction of barriers, deployment of more personnel and the investment in a wide range of military and security technologies from drones to smart border technologies that attempt to monitor, identify and prevent unauthorised movements are emblematic of this shift. We link this increasing militarisation to dehumanisation of migrant others and to the increasing mortality in border spaces. By documenting this trend and identifying a range of different practices that are included under the rubric of militarisation, this paper is both a call for nuanced interpretation and more sustained investigation of the expansion of the military into the policing of borders. © 2016 Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers).","Borders; European Union; Militarisation; Political geography; USA","border region; European Union; military government; political geography; regional security; sovereignty; Europe; United States",,,,,,,,,,,,"Johnson, C.; Department of Geography, United States; email: corey_johnson@uncg.edu",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",00202754,,,,"English","Trans.

This article takes a close look at one way in which officials try to overcome such conflicts: through technology. In West Africa, the secure ‘Seahorse’ network hardwires border cooperation into a satellite system connecting African and European forces. In Spain’s North African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, advanced border fencing has joined up actors around a supposedly impenetrable divide. And on the EU level, the ‘European external border surveillance system’, or Eurosur, papers over power struggles between agencies and states through ‘decentralized’ information-sharing – even as the system’s physical features (nodes, coordination centres, interfaces) deepen competition between them. The article shows how such technologies, rather than ‘halting migration’, have above all acted as catalysts for new social relations among disparate sectors, creating areas for collaboration and competition, compliance and conflict. With these dynamics in mind, the conclusion sketches an ‘ecological’ perspective on the materialities of border control – infrastructure, interfaces, vehicles – while calling for more research on their contradictory and often counterproductive consequences. © 2015, The Author(s) 2015.","Actor-network theory; border control; illegality; irregular migration; materiality",,"2014-15; Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/G01793X//1","This work was supported by an AXA Research Fund Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at LSE (2014-15), and by an earlier UK Economic and Social Research Council PhD Studentship (award number ES/G01793X//1).

This agenda has been particularly instrumental in cultivating migration anxieties and framing the problem of threat as an imperative to identify those who are dangerous to public safety. As well founded as that may be, it masks the pivotal role ICTs have in the supervision and administration of industries and markets. ICTs, including biometrics, are essential to supervise all four freedoms of movement in European market integration, i.e., of goods, services, capital and persons. They are essential to the EU-US trade and investment relationship which is increasingly underpinned by cross-border data flows, and the most significant such relationship globally. Drawing on mobilities research, this chapter explores how the mobilities of materials, commodities, markets and labour are simultaneously constrained and facilitated in transnational development, including the obligation in Europe to protect the fifth freedom of movement, that of data. While a recent European regulation aims to better protect personal data in these flows, the narratives of threat and emergency call for immediate action, whereby any data that can be intercepted can also be gathered for investigative purposes on the basis of exceptional circumstance. The securitization agenda finds its practical utility in the hands of executive powers who are largely avoiding the legislature and the judiciary. There is no evidence that authorities catch terrorists and criminals because of advanced ICTs and biometry in border control and data intercept. The practical utility lies in the ability to target and investigate any individual and a whole range of political opposition and activism which has very little if anything to do with threat and emergency. Publics have no meaningful defence apart from self-censorship. They have no meaningful way of objecting to exceptional circumstances in which illiberal practices are legitimized, and neither does the legislature and the judiciary unless the checks on executive powers are adequately reined in. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Biometry; Data protection; Data-driven markets; Economic growth; Economic leadership; Executive power; Fifth freedom; Free movement of data; freedom of expression; Securitization; Surveillance",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gunnarsdóttir, K.; Sociology Department, United Kingdom; email: k.gunnarsdottir@surrey.ac.uk",,"Springer Science and Business Media B.V.",18750044,,,,"English","Int.

The 10 years following the publication of the first edition of this Handbook has seen highly regarded psychological journals regularly publishing topics central to acculturation. Some journals in their desire to stimulate research have come out with topical issues on migration (see, e.g., Child development, 2012). As Van de Vijver et al. (Chapter 6, this volume) point out, we are witnessing an exponential increase in acculturation studies. Compared to the about 1,500 studies registered in PsycINFO during the first 100 years of acculturation psychology research, over 7,000 records could be identified following a cursory search in PsycINFO for the period from 2000 to the time of this writing. Why this increase? We tried to answer this question in the introduction to this volume (Chapter 1), where we pointed out that intercultural contacts are on the rise for several reasons. These included (1) easier and faster means for people to travel over wider distances together with bilateral agreements between nations, such as the Schengen agreement, making traveling easier, albeit amid tighter security checks; (2) developments in information technology that have brought people into contact, who until recently were very much isolated from each other; (3) the unabated but sad and traumatic man-made disasters of uprooting and relocating thousands of people because of ethnic, political and religious conflicts together with natural catastrophes that force people to flee to different regions of the world; (4) economic developments and economic meltdowns are still with us, forcing people to relocate either internally or internationally to seek greener pastures elsewhere. All these phenomena are major sources of intercultural contact, and of acculturation; hence they are of great interest to acculturation psychology. To be able to face and tackle the challenges these phenomena pose, acculturation psychology should regularly review and revise its assumptions and theories with supporting empirical research. And it is this goal that we hope this Handbook achieves. Another goal with the first edition of the Handbook was to move away from acculturation theories that have developed predominantly in one sociocultural context, such as the United States (see, e.g., Chun, Organizta & Marin, 2002; Leong, 2014). © Cambridge University Press 2016.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cambridge University Press",,9781316219218; 9781107103993,,,"English","The Camb.

However, by a certain paradox in many cases these illegal immigrants are entering the EU territory through the humanitarian aid to be extended to them by the EU costal border guards that on the basis of the principles of the International humanitarian law have to extend their help to these illegal immigrants in case of some necessary rescue operations from their drowning boats on the Mediterranean sea and bring them to the territory of the EU.

The ship's identity and position contained in AIS messages are picked up by low-orbit satellites then send back down to Data Processing Centres. SAT-AIS is able to assist European entities and institutions in law enforcement, fisheries control campaigns, customs, defence, maritime border control operations, maritime safety and security issues including marine pollution response, search and rescue and anti-piracy. The European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) are cooperating to maximise the provision and use of SAT-AIS data and have demonstrated several new SAT-AIS data services. EMSA and ESA have implemented a SATAIS Data Processing Centre (DPC) under a joint project team which is currently being integrated into the Integrated Maritime Data Environment (IMDatE) at EMSA to enhance the operational maritime services. Within ESA's Telecom Programme the next generation SAT-AIS receiver payload for the Norwegian NORSAT 1 mission has being developed and delivered to the Norwegian Space Centre as mission prime. The NAIS receiver features advanced in-orbit signal processing of up to 4 antennas and 6 AIS channels, still being suitable for nano- and micro-satellites resources (¡1.5 kg, ¡5W). NORSAT-1 launch and first results are planned for 2016. Through another project, a new generation of SAT-AIS micro-satellites is developed, within a Private Public Partnership with exactEarth as the customer, operator and service provider and LuxSpace as the satellite prime. The microsatellites will feature advanced antennas, signal processing and will downlink also the raw data received from ships to perform computing intensive processing on ground. The Satellite PDR was held end 2015 and phase C/D will proceed in 2016. With these projects, ESA's SAT-AIS programme boosts the identification and global tracking of ships with cutting-edge space and ground technology.

They flee conflicts, persecution and - of course - extreme poverty, and must therefore be welcomed, under the Geneva Convention and the Dublin Regulation. The Dublin III Regulation (No. 604/2013) is a European Union law that determines the EU Member State responsible for examining an application for asylum or refugee status under the Geneva Convention, which is usually the State through which the asylum seeker first entered the EU. Several EU countries are involved: first reception countries, such as Italy and Greece for what concerns Mediterranean migration, and other countries that grant asylum, such as Germany, followed by the UK, France, Italy and Spain. Monitoring migration flows is the most pressing issue, especially in first reception countries. A possible solution could be remote sensing of borders in migrant countries of origin, carried out by companies from destination countries. An example is the Treaty signed between Libya and Italy in 2008. A costly mechanism that, however, does not involve the use of police forces. The cost will be split between the destination country and the EU, based on existing agreements. Satellite monitoring could help save lives, enhance safety operations, counteract illegal migration, and prevent terrorists from entering the EU. All rescue and recovery operations now rely on satellite technology, and information on piracy and border control is provided in real time. Data is processed in Lisbon at the European Maritime Safety Agency, and all vessel traffic in European waters is traced by EMSA. Since the phenomenon involves Europe as a whole, and considering existing EU-ESA joint space initiatives, it would be advisable to entrust the European Space Agency with the tasks of satellite monitoring and remote sensing. The Sentinel-3 satellite - carrying sophisticated radar and optical instruments and currently used for the Copernicus environmental and security monitoring program - could also be used to locate and identify migrant vessels.",,"Binary alloys; Laws and legislation; Potassium alloys; Satellites; Space optics; Waterway transportation; European Space Agency; European Union Law; Maritime safety; Safety operations; Satellite monitoring; Satellite technology; Security monitoring; Sub-saharan africa; Remote sensing",,,,,,,,,,,,"Sgrosso, G.C.; University of RomeItaly; email: sgrossogabriella@gmail.com",,"International Astronautical Federation, IAF",00741795,,,,"English","Proc.

Cooperation with African countries (externalization) has been key to fostering fast return procedures, whereas cooperation with the EU (communitarization through joint Frontex operations) has only been complementary to national border control initiatives driven by technological innovation (technologization). An additional aspect analysed in this chapter is the emergence of a humanitarian border in the Spanish case, a scenario in which new forms of civil mobilization in defence of the human rights of migrants have emerged reactively.

Approaching borders as concepts in flux, the authors identify three main trends: the rise of security technologies such as the EUROSUR system, the continued externalization of EU security governance such as border mission training in third states, and the unfolding dynamics of accountability. The contributions show that internal security cooperation in Europe is far from consolidated, since both political oversight mechanisms and the definition of borders remain in flux. This edited volume makes a timely and interdisciplinary contribution to the ongoing academic and political debate on the future of open borders and legitimate security governance in Europe.

We are confronted with an unprecedented degree of controversy, politicization and pace of change with regard to migration and border security issues, while other internal security concerns, such as the fight against terrorism, remain on the agenda. The chapter then turns to the possible consequences of such transformation for academic study, and proposes an analytical focus on practices and diverse sites of implementation, as opposed to the traditionally dominant concern with policy-making dynamics in Brussels. In this context, we refer to borders and bordering processes as multi-dimensional phenomena that permeate spaces within and beyond the territory of the EU. Finally, the introductory chapter elaborates on the three organizing themes of technology, externalisation and accountability, which provide a fruitful cross-cutting, perspective on the increasing empirical complexity of the EU’s Area of Freedom, Security and Justice.

Cooperation between the EU, particular member states and other space-faring actors concerning space seems to be the only option to develop real capabilities since the pooling of resources is a precondition for the success. However, available research on that subject is primary focused on its economic part or political bargains, when other issues like security and interactions between technology and international affairs are omitted. Therefore, the paper discusses the transfer of European norms and ideas regarding outer space endeavours, by placing the emphasis on interactions between space affairs, security and technology on European security. In particular, the chapter surveys sectors, methods, and spheres of the European space policy, and analyses the empirical analysis of space applications and their implications for European internal security. Thus, it offers a critical technological as well as political analysis of the satellite-based capacities that the EU is currently creating, which contrasts with political statements and widely shared assumptions about the possibility of real-time “integrated border management”. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Border; Copernicus; European space policy; EUROSUR; Keywords; Outer space; Satellite imagery; Surveillance",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Słomczyńska, I.; Maria-Curie Skłodowska University, Plac Litewski 3, Poland; email: irma.slomczynska@umcs.edu.pl",,"Springer International Publishing",,9783319175607; 9783319175591,,,"English","EU Borders and Shifting Intern.

Changes in EU policies are not only the consequences of ‘grand moments’ of treaty and institutional changes. In order to identify and explain changes in everyday decision-making, one should complement the traditional strategic bargaining perspective on decision-making with a constructivist view on discourse or language as sources of change. With the insights of both constructivists and communication theorists, this study focuses on the identification of conditions and occurrences of deliberation in the daily running of decision-making in the EU that allow for changes facilitating the adoption of new policy instruments. In this light a study of two cases will be presented of which each has taken place in a different institutional setting. The main analysis of this study is on the drafting process of the Framework Decision on the European Evidence Warrant of 2008. The findings of this analysis will be compared to findings of another analysis. It concerns the negotiations on the Council Decision of 2008 regarding access for consultation of the Visa Information System by law enforcement authorities.

In analyzing these developments, this article, first, develops an analytical framework regarding the migration/security nexus through building upon Foucauldian approaches to biopolitics. This sociological stance offers a critical way to deconstruct how border control practices are formulated as strategies of containing and filtering certain group of migrants including irregular and poor migrants, asylum seekers and refugees. Second, through building upon document analysis, empirical application of this analytical background is carried out with a special focus on border control practices developed by the EU and Spain.

The technology is advanced and regulatory changes are underway which will allow their use in domestic airspace. As well as the functional and economic benefits of a strong civil RPAS sector, the potential benefits for the military RPAS sector are also widely recognised. Several actors have nurtured this dual-use aspect of civil RPAS development. However, concerns have been raised about the public rejecting the technology because of their association with military applications and potentially controversial applications, for example in policing and border control. In contrast with the enthusiasm for dual-use exhibited throughout the EC consultation process, the strategy for avoiding public rejection devised in its roadmap would downplay the connection between military and non-military RPAS and focus upon less controversial applications such as search and rescue. We reflect upon this contrast in the context of the European agenda of responsible research and innovation. In doing so, we do not rely upon critique of drones per se, in their neither their civil nor military guise, but explore the extent to which current strategies for managing their public acceptability are compatible with a responsible and socially beneficial development of RPAS for civil purposes. © 2014, The Author(s).","Drones; Dual-use; Responsible research and innovation; RPAS; UAV","aircraft; airplane pilot; attitude; civil rights; conflict; dual use research; ethics; Europe; human; law enforcement; legislation and jurisprudence; machiavellianism; marketing; military phenomena; procedures; public opinion; rescue work; robotics; social behavior; social control; soldier; technology; weapon; Aircraft; Attitude; Civil Rights; Dissent and Disputes; Dual Use Research; Europe; Humans; Law Enforcement; Machiavellianism; Marketing; Military Personnel; Military Science; Pilots; Public Opinion; Rescue Work; Robotics; Social Control, Formal; Social Responsibility; Technology; Weapons",,,,,,,,,,,,"Boucher, P.; Digital Citizen Security Unit, Via Enrico Fermi 2749, Italy; email: philip.boucher@jrc.ec.europa.eu",,"Springer Netherlands",13533452,,,"25371277","English","Sci.

Taking a sociotechnical approach, the research presents the positions of the key actants identified in relation to key controversies regarding the development of the settlement system and shows how the relations between the controversies and the positions of the actants involved in them evolve. By examining the role of ICTs in the evolution of these relations, the study seeks to illuminate the complex causalities between the social and technical aspects of cross-border capital market integration.

As a consequence, European states are restructuring their border regimes by externalizing migration management to non-EU countries beyond the border and creating new programs and policies to do so. Autonomy of Migration (AoM) offers a distinct way for thinking about border control mechanisms and goals of managing mobility. AoM does not read this off-shoring of borders through the lens of centralized and coordinated state powers, but develops an autonomous gaze that supplements these institutional readings of apparatuses of capture with a view that takes as its starting point the ways in which border architectures, institutions, and policies interact with and react to the turbulence of migrant mobilities. By engaging current EU externalization policies, this paper illustrates the shifting relationship between border control and mobility. Resumen: A pesar de las actualizaciones tecnológicas recientes de la frontera en el perímetro de la Unión Europea, la llamada ""Europa Fortaleza"", tanto como metáfora como realidad, continua sin poder controlar la migración irregular. En respuesta, los estados miembros de la Unión están restructurando sus sistemas fronterizos externalizando la gestión migratoria a países no miembros de la UE, delegando funciones de control migratorio a países fuera de la frontera europea. El enfoque de la Autonomia de la Migracion (AoM) ofrece un anáisis poco común para pensar los mecanismos de control fronterizo y sus objetivos de gestionar la movilidad humana. AoM no interpreta dicho desplazamiento de fronteras únicamente desde la óptica del poder estatal centralizado. AoM ofrece una mirada autonoma de la movilidad, complementando esas lecturas institucionales que enfatizan los aparatos de captura. Así, AoM enfatiza la turbulencia de las migraciones como parte constituyente, y no solo receptiva, de las arquitecturas, instituciones y políticas fronterizas.

We trace how sovereign decisions are enacted as assemblages in the antecedent register of device development through the everyday decisions of scientists and engineers in the laboratory, the security experts they engage, and the material components of the device itself. Drawing on in-depth interviews, observations, and ethnographic research of the EU-funded Handhold project, we explore how assumptions about the way security technologies will and should perform at the border shape the development of a portable, integrated device to detect chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosives (CBRNE) threats at borders. In disaggregating the moments of sovereign decision-making across multiple sites and times, we question the supposed linearity of how science comes out of and feeds back into the world of border security. An interrogation of competing assumptions and understandings of security threats and needs, of competing logics of innovation and pragmatism, of the demands of differentiated temporalities in detection and identification, and of the presumed capacities, behaviours, and needs of phantasmic competitors and end-users reveals a complex, circulating and co-constitutive process of device development that laboratises the border itself. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Borders; laboratories; technology; translation",,"Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Dstl; Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/K011332/1","This work was conducted as part of the TRUST: Tracing Risk and Uncertainty in Security Technology project supported by the UK Economic and Social Research Council and the UK Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (grant number ES/K011332/1).

This agenda has three main characteristics: usefulness, planning and stratification, and points to a new European mobility governance. This paper explores the implications and consequences of this agenda, including the critical analysis of the so-called «Hotspot approach» and other measures such as the «refugee relocation system». Confirming the trends in the last few years, the main tools in the European border management and control strategy are cooperation, policing, new control and identification technologies for the newcomers, and the «border extended bureaucracies». As a consequence, the most advanced border posts are pushed towards the South and militarized. This paper discusses the underlying racist utilitarianism contained in these European policies. Thus, Mediterranean's governmentality crystallizes in a series of mechanisms generating new forms of violence, symbolic and direct. In this context, the paper explores the parallel logics of the «will to mobility» of young migrants from the Global South who, in spite of the security web established in European policies wish and try to be part of a transnational cosmopolitan imaginary.","Border; Emergency; European Union; Immigration; Mobility",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Vacchiano, F.; Instituto de Ciências Sociais, Italy",,"CSIC Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas",00347981,,,,"Spanish","Rev.

Ethnographic data show how, for example, the today prestigious Spanish border control model in Gibraltar did not stop the problem but rather provoked the shiftof migratory flows to more dangerous routes in the Sahara and the North of Africa. Spain's problem eventually became Italy's problem and, in turn, as routes moved East, Greece's problem: a vicious cycle manifesting the failure of European policies. The author follows the life histories of migrants he worked in the route from Senegal to Morocco who, in their respective African transits, have had to face walls, borders, new surveillance technologies and cross-border mafias.

It discusses the rationalities of allowing entry as they are inscribed in the Schengen visa regulations and in the regulations relating to resident permits and family reunification rights in various European countries. Specifically the paper sheds light on how market veridiction results in the disciplining of human rights in these policies. The analysis is conducted through a Foucauldian governmentality framework entailing an analysis of the problematisations of immigration through market veridiction and how these are applied today to limit immigrants’ human rights. The paper then compares these rationalities to eugenic justifications for problematising immigration in the USA from 1860s onwards. This historical comparison shows how social Darwinist notions of human worth continue to function at the level of rationalities and technologies of disciplining immigrants’ human rights. The paper concludes that market veridiction makes human rights function inside a framework of (e)quality in which human worth is calculated as ‘quality’ and not as ‘equality’, and shows how migrants’ human rights are made to function as something to be earned rather than something inherent or inalienable. © 2015 Southseries Inc., www.thirdworldquarterly.com.","class; governmentality; human rights; immigration; market veridiction; social Darwinism","European Union; governance approach; human rights; immigrant population; immigration; immigration policy; policy analysis; Europe; United States",,,,,,,,,,,,"Rajas, J.; Department of Politics, United Kingdom; email: jarmilarajas@gmail.com",,"Routledge",01436597,,,,"English","Third World Q.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938542467

Design/methodology/approach – This paper draws on extensive background research and qualitative in-depth interviews conducted in 2013 for the European Union (EU) FP-7 project “FastPass – A harmonized, modular reference system for all European automatic border crossing points”. Findings – The Smart Borders proposal not only compounds the individual concerns related to the use of biometrics in border controls and automatisation thereof, but also has serious issues of its own, premier among which is the imposition of a two-tier border control system. Social implications – The paper is a catalyst for open debate on the fundamental questions of how we got to this point and where do we want to go. It questions the process by which the increased use of IT in border controls has become the norm and policy trend in Europe, and discusses where the limits could be drawn from a fundamental rights perspective. In particular, it warns against the institutionalisation of a two-tier border control system among third-country nationals. Originality/value – Little attention is given to the fundamental rights concerns raised for EU and non-EU citizens as related to biometrics and their use in ABCs, and how these issues are reproduced in the Smart Borders proposal.

The first is the emerging notion of humanitarian 'migrant-centredness' found in the policies of elites and security professionals in the field of EUropean border security and migration management. The second is the use of animalised metaphors and imagery that pervade narratives of 'irregular' migrants' embodied experiences of detention across and beyond EUrope. It argues that what is at stake in this juxtaposition is more than simply a discrepancy between the 'rhetoric' of neoliberal bordering and the 'reality' of 'irregular' migrants' experiences. Such a view, which is commonly held among diverse critics of border violence, ultimately makes a problematic appeal back to the very humanitarian frame that has already been coopted by authorities associated with or even complicit in that violence. Seeking an alternative diagnosis and ground for critique beyond the 'rhetoric/reality' bind, the analysis draws on conceptual resources found in (post)biopolitical theory - particularly Jacques Derrida's concept of 'zoopolitics' - in order to identify and explore animalisation as a specific spatial technology of power. Understanding the work that the zoopolitical threshold does in shaping contemporary spaces of incarceration and producing animalised subjects offers new insights into both governmental logics of border security and the limits of humanitarian-based critiques. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Biopolitics; Borders; Humanitarianism; Migration; Security; Sovereignty",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Vaughan-Williams, N.; Department of Politics and International Studies, University of WarwickUnited Kingdom",,"Elsevier Ltd",09626298,,,,"English","Polit.

This bookprovides the analytical capability to understand and explore the dynamics of globalisation. It is anchored in economic input-output models of over 200 countries and their relationships through trade, migration, security and development aid. The tools of complexity science are brought to bear and mathematical and computer models are developed both for the elements and for an integrated whole. Models are developed at a variety of scales ranging from the global and international trade through a European model of inter-sub-regional migration to piracy in the Gulf and the London riots of 2011. The models embrace the changing technology of international shipping, the impacts of migration on economic development along with changing patterns of military expenditure and development aid. A unique contribution is the level of spatial disaggregation which presents each of 200+ countries and their mutual interdependencies - along with some finer scale analyses of cities and regions. This is the first global model which offers this depth of detail with fully work-out models, these provide tools for policy making at national, European and global scales. © 2016 John Wiley and Sons Ltd.

Elections are won or lost based on political parties’ perceived (in)ability to secure Australian borders, especially from asylum seekers coming to Australia by boat (Manne, The Comment: Asylum seekers, 2010). Elsewhere across the Western world, border policing and regulating mobile bodies are also a priority, creating modern ‘factories of exclusion’ (Engbersen 2001) based on hi-tech mechanisms of social segregation, especially surveillance (see Broeders 2007; Koslowski 2004). With a budget over ε 320 million set for drone development (Waterfield, EU ‘spent ε 320 million on surveillance drone development’, 2014), we are witnessing ‘an emerging EU drone policy’ (Hayes et al., EURODRONES Inc, 2014;) that gradually spills across the border, to the neighbouring countries of Global South. This chapter looks at the process of re-bordering of both Global North and Global South through case studies of Australia and Serbia. It highlights the development of security and surveillance border control technologies in both countries, especially in the context of the usage of drones in border policing. The chapter’s purpose is not to offer a comparative analysis of two case studies; rather, it seeks to illuminate the issue of drone use in border policing from opposing sides of the borderland. The chapter presents preliminary findings from a research project that looks at mobility and border control in Western Balkans in the context of the European Union (EU) integration, conducted in the period August-December 2013. It also draws on the analysis of media reporting on drones in Serbia and Australia in the past 2 years, in order to explore predominant narratives around the usage of surveillance technologies in border control. This chapter argues that, although the rhetoric in the use of drones in two contexts is largely different, the military rhetoric underpins both military and non-military use of drones. Finally, the chapter begins to examine the impact of surveillance-based, drone-led border policing on mobile bodies caught in the ‘drone stare’ (Wall and Monahan). © 2016 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Australia; Border security; Frontex; Maritime surveillance; Migration control; Serbia; The fortress europe",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Milivojevic, S.; School of Social Sciences, Australia; email: s.milivojevic@unsw.edu.au",,"Springer International Publishing",,9783319237602; 9783319237596,,,"English","Drones and Unmanned Aerial Systems: Legal and Social Implications for Security and Surveillance",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017056111

Border surveillance is one of the top priorities of the member states of the EU for several reasons: the most prominent is the fight against irregular migration and cross-border crime. Within this context, public agencies (at both the national and the European level) are investing important resources in deploying the most up-to-date technologies, in an attempt to stop undesired migrants. The deployment of drones for border policing purposes is already a reality in the USA, and also in some EU member states. Frontex has also devoted attention and resources to exploring the possibility of deploying drones in border surveillance, as they are seen as beneficial assets in the perspective of European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR). The aim of this chapter is to explore the recent developments constituted by the deployment of drone technology in border surveillance. The chapter first introduces the actors, policies and practices in the sphere of border management, specifically in the area of border surveillance (1); then it discusses the use of drone technology for border surveillance, looking not only at its potentialities but also at its current shortcomings (2); it will then move toward the regulatory framework enabling the safe deployment of drones under aviation law and on border surveillance (3) and presents the constraints represented by fundamental rights and data protection rules on drone technology and the challenges drones represent for the human rights of migrants (4), before concluding that drone technology might entail a further securitisation of border surveillance, together with a shift toward preventive border surveillance (5). © 2016 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Border surveillance; Data protection; Drones; EUROSUR; Frontex; Operation mare nostrum; Privacy; RPAS; Schengen borders code; UAVs",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Marin, L.; Department of Law, Netherlands; email: l.marin@uu.nl",,"Springer International Publishing",,9783319237602; 9783319237596,,,"English","Drones and Unmanned Aerial Systems: Legal and Social Implications for Security and Surveillance",Book Chapter,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017047610

It is a composite term, derived from the Greek words syn (συν)#orio (óριοborder, frontier, limit, boundary)logia (λογíα, from, λóγος scientific discourse). This term may comprise the theoretical and practical research into all kinds of boundaries (physical, mathematical, social, cultural etc.). Establishing an integrated environmental monitoring system for any cross-border infrastructure is clearly a difficult problem. This paper aims to explore the risks and difficulties involved in such projects from the point of view of Synoriology, indicating that the establishment of major technological components involves certain mathematical approaches. One key question is controlling and securing environmental stability during and after the construction of a technical project, both spatially and functionally. Other issues may also be examined, such as landuse planning around a site’s area, emergency response measures etc. This work takes into account results of various European Union-funded programs on cross-border infrastructure, as well as the author’s own research on these issues. It gradually becomes clear that statistical approaches should constitute only the basic steps towards integrated monitoring and management systems.

The European Commission has recently proposed a legislative package on “EU Smart Borders” composed of an Entry-Exit System (EES) and the Registered Travellers Programme (RTP). This article examines the ways in which the EU Smart Borders reframe the traditional understandings and configurations of the EU border control system and its migration management toolkit of technologies. It is argued that smart borders take us a step further in the re-framing of mobility and identity controls in the EU Schengen apparatus. EU discourses backing up these measures have not been so much centered on the insecuritization of irregular immigration. They have instead questioned the effectiveness of the existing EU border regime, and used a “de-securitization” and facilitation of the mobility discourse hiding “discrimination by default.” Smart borders aim at identifying the future potential “irregular overstayer” and generalizing the management of mobility and identity of all non-EU travelers by implementing a person-driven approach. This approach transforms the essence of border controls in Europe and reframes the EU travel documents policy by moving away from a nationality-based approach of border controls towards another based on risk and profiling. © 2015 Association for Borderlands Studies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Carrera, S.; Head of the Justice and Home Affairs Section, Place du Congres 1, Belgium",,"Routledge",08865655,,,,"English","J.

After both countries joined the EU (2004) and the Schengen area (2007), the importance of boundaries as barriers significantly weakened. The joint research team of Czech and Polish geographers evaluated the permeability of 100 km long sections of the border according to the criteria for which are publicly available data and GIS processing technology. Following criteria were used for the border permeability evaluation: the presence of orographic or hydrologic barriers in two levels of intensity, the number of road crossings, the number of other crossings, the availability of the inland roads, contrast of population density in the border micro-regions, the number of entrepreneurs from the neighboring country in the villages on the other side of the border, the number of solved micro-projects and the number of solved large projects.

Scenarios are often used to deal with uncertainty. A novel backcasting methodology has been tested in which a normative objective (e.g. adaptive water management) is backcasted within the context of exploratory scenarios that sketch four different plausible futures (Economy First, Policy Rules, Fortress Europe, and Sustainability Eventually). The main advantage of combining exploratory and normative scenarios is in the identification of robust actions: actions that are effective in the different socio-environmental contexts sketched in the exploratory scenarios. This paper has three objectives: (1) to present the methodology, focussing on its novel aspects (2) to test the methodology and evaluate its perceived success by analysing organiser and stakeholder feedback and (3) to analyse and evaluate the results, in order to study the impact of the exploratory scenarios on the backcasting results and the added value of robust actions. The methodology was successfully tested in 9 local and one regional case study in a water project water scenarios for Europe and for Neighbouring States (SCENES). Results showed that the exploratory scenarios influenced the content of the backcasts, thus making the identification of robust strategies possible. The list of robust strategies includes both technological and social/organisational strategies, highlighting the need for an integrated approach. The approach shows high potential, but as the methodology is in its infancy more research is needed, particularly in methods to facilitate and monitor information flow between exploratory scenarios and backcasts. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Backcasting; Exploratory scenarios; Participation; Policy development; Robust strategies; Water management",,"Sixth Framework Programme, FP6: 036822","This research was funded by SCENES (EC-funded FP6, Contract number 036822) and Knowledge for Climate (Theme 7).

Current European border control practices create three spaces of control: externalised borders, through readmission and return agreements which enrol third countries in border control; the EU borders themselves through the work of Frontex and the development of a whole arsenal of technology tools for controlling mobility to and from the EU; and the Schengen area, whose regulations tend to reinforce deterrence at the borders through the Smart Border System. As a result, the EU’s balancing act between irregular migration control and protection of refugees and human life clearly tips towards the former, even if it pays lip service to the latter. More options for mobility across the Mediterranean and more cooperation for growth are essential ingredients of a sustainable migration management policy on the EU’s southern borders. In addition asylum management could benefit from EU level humanitarian visas issued at countries of origin. © 2014 Istituto Affari Internazionali.","European Union; Greece; human rights; Mediterranean; migration; refugee",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Triandafyllidou, A.; Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies (RSCAS), Italy",,"Routledge",03932729,,,,"English","Int.

In the last two decennia various concepts of ABCs have been developed mainly driven by pure technological and industrial viewpoints. Those systems are nowadays tested and even employed in regular operation by many states and reveal several drawbacks. Various security technologies are used for such complex ABC solutions including biometrics, surveillance, certificate exchange, data protection, secure user interaction and information security. Hence, the FastPass project proposes a multiple stakeholders driven approach emphasizing user's needs and providing a deeper look into the security technologies to estimate the risk, challenges and opportunities of an automated approach.

A formal draft of the Regulation was published in January 2012, after a draft was leaked in December 2011, and since that time considerable debate has been generated. The Regulation is intended to replace the current EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC (‘the Directive’). The European Commission intends to take the opportunity to update the rules regarding data protection as it is felt that some changes in information technology, particularly those relating to web 2.0 technologies, have outgrown the original regulatory framework. Since publication by the Commission, very many significant amendments have been proposed to the original draft, including several by the influential Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE Committee) of the European Parliament, and again in what has come to be known as ‘the compromise text’ in a note authored under the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union. Some 3,000 amendments have been suggested in all. Much of the discussion and debate centres on provisions that are not of direct concern to the issue of genetic discrimination. However, some of them are. In what follows I hope to provide a sense of the current direction of travel; to indicate how some of the ambitions of the Regulation intersect with the concern of improved protection from unfair genetic discrimination; to point to a couple of currently contested provisions relevant to the potential scope and nature of such protection; and to indicate why the changes proposed by the Commission, and the amendments subsequently suggested, fall short in an important respect from a comprehensive response to the concerns that people have expressed in relation to genetic discrimination. Unless otherwise indicated, all references are to the Commission text as amended by the proposals of the LIBEcommittee on 22 November 2013.1A key ambition of the new framework includes assuring consumer trust in the online environment as it continues to develop. It is considered a key purpose of the reform as any lack of trust ‘risks slowing down the development of innovative uses of new technologies’.2 In addition, it is considered an appropriate moment to tackle the lack of harmonisation across the EU on data protection. The nature of the current Directive is that member states must implement its requirements locally through domestic legislation. Although the requirements are themselves common, the fact that they have been implemented differently, has not led to the level of harmonisation that was originally intended. As the Regulation would be directly applicable, and would not require any local implementation, it should successfully achieve a higher degree of harmonisation across the EU. © 2015 selection of editorial material, Gerard Quinn, Aisling de Paor and Peter Blanck.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Taylor, M.; School of Law, United Kingdom",,"Taylor and Francis",,9781135044619; 9780415836937,,,"English","Genetic Discrimination: Transatl.

Consequently, the EU suffered from the same truncated thinking and piecemeal approach to the adoption of technologies to realize its policy goals that bedevilled national and local governments. Inevitably, part of the problem lay in the financial constraints arising from the banking crisis and subsequent recession across most of Europe. Another part arose from the lack of understanding among policy-makers and officials about how the concept of ‘border’ had shifted from a territorial focus linked to the geophysical boundaries of a state to a functionally determined conception. © 2015 José M.

The preamble to the treaty reads like pulp fiction – it raises moral panics about piracy, counterfeiting, organised crime, and border security. The agreement contains provisions on civil remedies and criminal offences, copyright law and trademark law, the regulation of the digital environment, and border measures. Memorably, Susan Sell called the international treaty “a TRIPS Double-Plus Agreement” because its obligations far exceed those of the World Trade Organization’s TRIPS Agreement 1994, and TRIPS-Plus Agreements, such as the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement 2004. The ACTA lacks the language of other international intellectual property agreements, which emphasise the need to balance the protection of intellectual property owners with the wider public interest in access to medicines, human development, and transfer of knowledge and technology. In Australia, there was much controversy both about the form and the substance of ACTA. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was a partisan supporter of ACTA. Nonetheless, there was criticism from a wide range of stakeholders about the treaty. After holding hearings and taking note of the position of the European Parliament and the controversy in the United States, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties in the Australian Parliament recommended the deferral of ratii cation of ACTA. This was striking – as representatives of all the main parties agreed on the recommendation. © Pedro Roffe and Xavier Seuba 2015.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rimmer, M.; Australian National University College of LawAustralia",,"Cambridge University Press",,9781107707207; 9781107070127,,,"English","The ACTA and the Plurilateral Enforc.

Terrorist groups can use sophisticated methods which involve explosives, biological and radioactive agents, and also new threats involving 'digital' attacks. Ports represent significant challenges when implementing new security measures. They cover large geographical areas, they have very complex operations, they service large numbers of passengers and they process large volumes of goods. Maintaining high efficiency in the transportation of goods and passengers is vital to a port. As well as efficient surveillance and access control, this requires efficient organizational and technological interfaces, linking ports to border control authorities, the police, other intervention forces, and transport and logistics operators. Research and Innovation have also shown that the complexity and cost of port operations for intra-European freight is one of the major obstacles for shifting more freight from roads onto sea. The introduction of new security measures can easily make this situation worse and it is important to start to look at how one can improve security while, hopefully, reducing operational complexity and cost in European ports. In order to achieve that, new approaches on risk assessment are being considered through FP7 research cooperation projects such as SUPPORT or CONTAIN. © 2014 IEEE.","attacks; innovation; ISPS; ports; risk; security","Biological materials; Innovation; Risk assessment; Risks; attacks; Intervention forces; ISPS; Operational complexity; ports; Research cooperation; security; Transportation of goods; Terrorism",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"IEEE Computer Society",,9781479961719,,,"English","IISA - Int.

How do these practices operate? How are they assembled? In the resulting assemblage, is the notion of borders - understood as state borders - still relevant for the control of individuals and populations moving across the frontiers of the EU? Drawing on empirical observations and with a specific focus on how border control is translated into different social universes, this article seeks to show that practices of control are routinely embedded in a practical sense that informs what controlling borders does and means. This practical sense is itself informed by different professional habitus and work routines involving deterrence and the use of force, interrogation and detention, surveillance of populations on the move and the profiling of (un)trusted travellers. Its strength varies in relation to its shared dimension by most of the operators, and is adjusted to the materiality of borders as well as to the local contexts in which it is deployed. It activates, or does not activate, the maximal use of various control technologies (satellites, pre-registration and interoperable exchange of data between the state and private bureaucracies, biometrics identifiers, body-scanners). For understanding practices of (in)securitization, actual work routines and the specific professional 'dispositions' are therefore more important than any discourses actors may use to justify their activities. © The Author(s) 2014.","civil society; critical theory; European Union; foreign policy; securitization; security; violence",,"European Commission; Seventh Framework Programme","The three dimensions of the management of security and its relation to borders can also be viewed through Foucauldian lenses. Yes, border controls continue to exist as a combination of three dimensions, called by some researchers an assemblage. In the first dimension, they exist as the locus of practices of sovereignty and exception. The second dimension adds a disciplinarization of the body, with the biometric identifiers organizing controls and detention centres within a liberal logic, applying security at the limits of freedom, and developing forms of statistical discriminations of population organizing a biopolitical governmentality. The third dimension of cloudy borders, seen through computerized data, emerges as as a refinement of biopolitics. Computerized surveillance technologies make it possible to gather traces, to organize dataveillance, and to fight virtual data wars. In concluding, I would like nevertheless to distantiate myself from this over generalization of a certain form of Foucaldianism, and instead stress the formative practices that are linked to the different patrimony of dispositions and the practical sense resulting from different professional socializations: these can better explain the process of (in)securitization of EU border controls. The socio-anthropology of the different social universes of border controls and their assemblage cannot be reduced to a ‘new’ characteristic of a general form of governmentality by biopolitics, which has existed at least from the 19th century onwards. Biopolitics cannot be transformed into an immanent cause or, even worse, be seen as a causal determination of today’s practices of border controls. Biopolitics is not a structure, a paradigm, or an ideal type in Foucault’s writings. What biopolitics can tell us is that a change is underway, a change that goes beyond biopolitics: this is the differentiation of the corporeal body and of the data double, and the emergence of traceability discussed by Foucault of the dissociated human being created by the computerization of the third universe. But this trend itself is not generally applicable everywhere. It works only for a specific social universe and for certain persons, not for all. An assemblage is not a system. Some dispositions are activated; others are inhibited. For example, in the field of military strategy, killing is inhibited while containment and deterrence are activated, as well as indifference to the lives of individuals around; and in the field of internal security, mass containment is inhibited but individual suspicion and disdain of legal frameworks are activated. Human skills in detection are valued as regards risk assessment, but they are restrained in the universe of dataveillance, where risk assessment works through discriminatory statistical reasoning and calculus of uncertainty. The characteristics activated by the third universe fit particularly well with the thesis put forward by Claudia Aradau and Rens van Munster (2011) concerning the prevalence of the notion of uncertainty as a form of governing, distinct from coercion and deterrence. Nevertheless, in my view, the programme at work in terms of an assemblage connecting the three universes, despite their heterogeneous translations, is what we could call Global Preventive Surveillance. By this I mean a form of timely geolocalized surveillance that envisions successful ‘smart borders’, or a GPS security, simultaneously open and secure; mobile borders, where experts and computer analysts smoothly regulate the political contradictions and paradoxes, by managing the world at a distance, even if the effective diagram of the practices of control may be strewn with rocks and shoals, disobedience and resistance, and victims of accidents ( Bigo, 2013 ). Undoubtedly, data border controls are not producing deaths as in the field of military strategy, nor are they producing arbitrary detentions and expulsions as in the field of internal security – but they are producing dataveillance, data-bans and data prevention, creating ‘local traps’ where people are forced to live in places where they do not want to live and where they can be forgotten. In the process, some populations end up being less human than others. This may help to explain the translation of control into the politics of indifference that is found in all three universes, as if the individual human beings crossing borders were less and less ‘real’, and more and more just ‘numbers’. Funding This specific research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors, but it is a follow-up of the FP7 research programme INEX and the FP6 Challenge. 1. The interviews began under the FP6 Challenge research programme, financed by the European Commission. It involved a group of researchers working on the Polish borders, on visa regulation, the practices of airline companies, and the creation of the Frontex agency. This research has been followed by the FP7 INEX that is more specialized on the technologies used at the borders, and that involved in-depth interviews conducted by myself (author), and by Julien Jeandesboz and some of my PhD and MA students, as well as by some civil servants responsible for the training of border guards and policemen who agreed to participate in the questioning. It has been continued by research undertaken for the European Parliament on ‘smart borders’. 2. On the research protocol, it was quite impossible to present and obtain a signed ethical form. All informants agreed to speak, but on the condition that they would not be identified directly or recorded. The secrecy and the fear of the hierarchy is one of the transversal characteristics of the professionals of security. It makes the use of direct quotes more difficult, except with regards to those at the highest of levels whereby employees are more public relations-oriented than operational agents or analysts, and therefore are also the least interesting in terms of practices. The terminologies in inverted commas that are given in the text to characterize the social universes are the ones from the software of text analysis tool ANTA, in which we entered the major official documents, allowed us to extract and calculate, that have been repeated the most in the different You Tube videos, and were used repeatedly in the interviews. The combination of these three techniques helped us to understand the translation of border controls in each social universe and their assemblage. 3. See: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-rIlXq5wOQ . 4. The terminology of (in)securitization practices used here refers to the sociological approach of critical security studies (Bigo, Dillon, Huysmans). In this approach, security does not diminish insecurity and we do not even have two sides generating a dynamics of co-constitution of opposites: we have only one side in a non-orientable surface (as in a Möbius strip) that we have to call (in)security, or an (in)securitization process ( Bigo, 2001 ). In this specific article, it means, for example, that border controls and their technologies do not solve the insecuritization of borders; they propagate fears of mobility in their everyday routines. 5. Of course, we know that the scale of this observation is large and that more complexity will ensue if we introduce the detailed national and local determinations as well as the types of borders (land, sea or air), but the object here is to focus on the identification of the transversal processes of (in)securitization in the EU in order to find some dispositional properties that are singular to this specific scale and context. 6. Translation is here used to signal not only a process of homogenization and of establishing equivalence, but also a topos of incommensurability and difference. Therefore the notion of assemblage works as a process of de-assembling and re-assembling these differences (see Sakai and Solomon, 2005 ). 7. EU-LISA is the EU Agency for large-scale IT systems.

In this article, we use the management of borders and populations in Europe as an empirical example to make a theoretical claim about race. We introduce the notion of the phenotypic other to argue that race is a topological object, an object that is spatially and temporally folded in distributed technologies of governance. To elaborate on these notions, we first examine a number of border management technologies through which both race and Europe are brought into being. More specifically we focus on how various such technologies aimed at monitoring the movement of individuals together with the management of populations have come to play crucial roles in Europe. Different border management regimes, we argue, do not only enact different versions of Europe but also different phenotypic others. We then shift the focus from border regimes to internal practices of governance, examining forensic DNA databanks to unravel articulations of race in the traffic between databases and societies. © The Author(s) 2013.","border management regimes; databases; phenotypic other; race",,,,,,,,,,,,,"M'charek, A.; University of Amsterdam, OZ Achterburgwal 185, Amsterdam 1012 DK, Netherlands; email: a.a.mcharek@uva.nl",,"SAGE Publications Inc.",01622439,,,,"English","Sci.

The theoretical reading of the documents of the national and EU integrated border management provides a new concept of spatial and temporal dimensions of borders and border enforcement in Finland. Secondly, by studying the practices and rationales of border management in an individual EU Member State, it is possible to gain an understanding of how contemporary EU border policy and security rationales alongside which borders have shifted extra- and intra-territorially are incorporated into the work of national border agencies. It points out how the new temporal and spatial dimensions of borders are rationalized in terms of security and efficiency, something that is believed to be achieved through the measures of outsourcing, internationalization and prevention.

European document experts and automated document inspection systems were challenged to recognize genuine and false documents under a very tight time constraint. Although the experiment suffered of many methodological weaknesses due to the limitations of the context in which it was conducted, a number of initial observations can be drawn on the importance of human skills and experience, the strengths and shortcomings of automated systems, and the need to further test and study how human and machine capabilities can be improved and combined in order to increase their detection effectiveness and thus strengthen border security. © 2013 IEEE.","Automated Document Inspection System; Border Control; Document Fraud; Electronic Passports; Human-Machine Interaction; Risk Analysis","Border control; Document Fraud; Electronic passports; Human machine interaction; Inspection system; Automation; Information science; Inspection equipment; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Crime",,,,,,,,,,,,"Frontex, Research and Development Unit, Warsaw, Poland",,,,9780769550626,,,"English","Proc. - Eur.

Current debates on this issue have been largely restricted to a technologically determinist approach that reduces the focus to problems of data misuse and privacy, precluding other pertinent ethical and political concerns. In response, the article engages with Giorgio Agamben's elaborations on the concepts of biopolitics and exception as an alternative way of analysing the use of biometric technology in the governance of forced migrants. It begins with a critical overview of Agamben's conceptualization of biopolitics and the state of exception. It then considers the Eurodac database and the UK's asylum Application Registration Cards as examples to demonstrate how current policies of immigration control and border management are implicated in the logic of exception. It argues that illiberal practices, such as biometric profiling and fingerprinting of asylum seekers and their incarceration in detention centres, are being enforced upon certain groups in ways that render their exclusion from the official juridico-political structure as an 'inclusive exclusion'. Importantly, the function creep of biometrics is not to be understood as the turning of exception into the rule in a somewhat homogenous way, but more as a polysemic process, which involves different forms of discipline and control that are irreducible to one singular paradigm. © The Author 2013.Published by Oxford University Press.All rights reserved.","Agamben; Asylum; Biometrics; Biopolitics; ICTs; Refugees","asylum seeker; biometry; immigration policy; information and communication technology; national identity; political integration; refugee; social exclusion; United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,"Ajana, B.; Department of Culture, United Kingdom; email: btihaj.ajana@kcl.ac.uk",,,09516328,,,,"English","J.

A growing academic literature explains the digitisation of border controls as an instance of the post-9/11 securitisation of migration policy. This paper re-examines why European states are digitising their border controls, and then explores how 'pre-emptive mobility governance' works. Although security imperatives play a role in accelerating digitisation, a securitisation framing obscures continuities with pre-9/11 practices and underplays other policy drivers. Pre-emptive mobility governance is best characterised as a digital-era version of 'remote control', and is shaped by other organisational and political rationales-first, instrumental beliefs about the efficiency gains of border technologies; second, their symbolic role in the context of the domestic politicisation of immigration.

Interest in border studies has increased with recent changes in geographical locations of the border or the fluctuation of the permeability of the border between some countries, such as in the European Union. Whether the nations are trying to increase traffic flow of the border or to implement stricter border control, having appropriate information of the border is crucial for effective policymaking. The objective of this research was to identify areas of high porosity, or high permeability, for pedestrians along the southern national border region in Carinthia, Austria using terrain, land use, and road data along with geocomputational methods. Two unsupervised classification methods, the fuzzy K-means clustering and the Self-Organizing Map, were applied to segment the border into homogeneous zones according to topographic and infrastructural attributes. The fuzzy Kmeans clustering method was chosen for its ability to allow for a continuous approach to classification. With this method, an object can belong, with different degrees of membership, to multiple classes, which is a more realistic reflection of the natural world than discrete clustering, where each object can only belong to one class. However, the fuzzy K-means clustering method does have disadvantages, i.e. the user must determine the number of classes and the input parameters are required to be in continuous format. The second classification method, the Self-Organizing Map, is a type of artificial neural network and was chosen for its ability to automatically determine the number of classes and handle categorical data. The Self-Organizing Map is unique because it can transform high dimensional data into low dimensional display while preserving the topology and spatial distribution of the input parameters. The results of the two classification methods suggest that the fuzzy K-means classification is more effective than the Self-Organizing Map for this situation. However, more research is needed to determine the fit of these algorithms for particular spatial data classification tasks. The results obtained from this research provide an insight into the permeability of the border region of Carinthia, Slovenia, and Italy to pedestrian traffic and can be potentially useful for decision making processes for tourism development and road transportation management in that region. Furthermore, the approach presented in this article can be applied to other national borders to identify zones permeable to pedestrian traffic. © 2013 Cartography and Geographic Information Society.","Border studies; GIS; Spatial clustering; Spatial decision support; Visual analytics","Border studies; Classification methods; Decision making process; Geographical locations; Spatial clustering; Spatial Decision Support; Unsupervised classification; Visual analytics; Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Conformal mapping; Decision making; Decision support systems; Geographic information systems; Neural networks; Research; Research and development management; Data mining; algorithm; artificial neural network; border region; classification; comparative study; decision making; fuzzy mathematics; GIS; land use; pedestrian; policy making; road transport; terrain; territorial management; tourism development; transportation planning; Austria; Carinthia; Italy; Slovenia",,,,,,,,,,,,"Hisakawa, N.; Department of Geography, United States; email: nghisakawa@gmail.com",,,15230406,,CGSCF,,"English","Cartogr.

As its name suggests, the concept of autonomy of migration's core thesis proposes that migratory movements yield moments of autonomy in regards to any attempt to control and regulate them. Yet, the concept of autonomy of migration has been repeatedly accused of being based on and contributing to a romanticisation of migration. After outlining two advantages the concept of autonomy of migration offers for the analysis of biometric border regimes, I demonstrate that processes of biometric rebordering increase the warranty of the two allegations, which feed this major critique. Drawing on examples relating to the Visa Information System, I show that processes of biometric rebordering alter the practical terms and material conditions for moments of autonomy of migration to such an extent that it becomes necessary to rethink not only some of the concept of autonomy of migration's central features, but the notion of autonomy itself. In the final section, I therefore point out some directions to develop the concept of autonomy of migration as an approach, which is better equipped to investigate today's struggles of migration without being prone to the critique of implicating a romanticisation of migration. © The Author(s) 2013.","Autonomy of migration; biometric rebordering; securitisation; security dispositif; situated knowledge",,"European Research Council: ERC-AG-SH2","In this article I have attributed the neglect of the technologisation of border controls and its effects on migrants’ room for manoeuvre by the existing CAM literature to a misreading of the securitisation of migration as a mere means for the disenfranchisement and economic exploitation of migrant labour. In order to overcome this economic reductionism, I have proposed to draw on Foucault’s notion of the security dispositif to conceptualise today’s border regimes. As Foucault perceives the security dispositif primarily as a dispositif of circulation, it brings out that security concerns and the promotion of freedom of movement are not in tension, but operate in tandem. It is the interplay between the two that drives the adoption of a pro-active risk management approach that in turn explains the ‘technological imperative’ characterising contemporary processes of rebordering. But the conception of contemporary border regimes as security dispositifs affords to reconsider at least two of the CAM’s propositions. Firstly, abjection and banishment have to be conceived as integral moments of governing human mobility through differential inclusion. Adopting the notion of banishment does not, however, imply a return to the paradigm of exclusion. In contrast to exclusion, banishment does not aim at the repression of mobility, but at its institutionalisation. The abject are kept in constant rotation by being subjected to the paradoxical freedom of the ban ‘to go anywhere except where one wants to go’. 111 This is important to note because it was the paradigm of exclusion that the CAM’s proponents sought to critique and replace with the notion of differential inclusion in the first place. Secondly, the CAM needs a new justification for the analytical-strategical prioritisation of migrants’ practices. It is important to retain this feature of the CAM because it efficiently allows for avoiding a control-biased analysis of technologically ever-more sophisticated borders regimes. But the CAM’s proposition, whereupon migration temporarily precedes the attempts to control and regulate it, becomes untenable in the face of the security dispositif’s risk management approach, which strives to render unknown future behaviours knowable in order to make them actionable and governable. What this pro-active risk management approach brings to the fore is that the CAM’s assumption of a temporal precedence of migration is underpinned by a reductive reading of power relations. 112 It therefore becomes requisite to rethink the concept of autonomy in such a way that it offers an alternative, more convincing justification for analytical-strategical prioritisation of migrants’ practices. This brings me to the final, albeit most crucial, modification of the CAM: the challenge to rethink the meaning of autonomy in relation to migration. To engage with this challenge is necessary in order to develop the CAM as an approach that is no longer prone to the accusation of being based on, as well as contributing to, a romanticisation of migration. It becomes urgent to engage with this challenge because the warranty of the two allegations, which fuel this major critique, increases in the context of biometric rebordering. The analysis of the impact of biometric technologies on migrants’ possibilities to appropriate mobility and rights allows me to indicate two starting points for the task to rethink autonomy as a concept. Firstly, it is important to develop a situated reading of autonomy which captures that mobility is always embodied and relational in order to bring out the diversity of migrants’ lived experiences and practices. This is a prerequisite for restoring the CAM’s capacity to critique the discriminatory effects of biometric borders. The latter implies a simultaneous intensification and concealment of the differentiation of how the border is experienced, depending on people’s subject position in terms of class, ‘race’, gender, country of origin, age and other factors. Donna Haraway’s concept of situated knowledge offers a promising starting point for such a re reading of autonomy. 113 Secondly, a rethinking of autonomy needs to answer the question of what the assertion of an autonomy of migration refers to in the face of biometric border regimes that transform migrants’ bodies into a means of mobility control. What the example of biometric rebordering brings to the fore is that governmental technologies for the regulation and control of human mobility have become so pervasive and intrusive that a rethinking of autonomy has to go beyond its Greek etymology of ‘self-legislation’. Nor is it credible any more to simply equate autonomy with some form of independency, as in the original formulation of the CAM’s core hypothesis in the pioneering work of Yann Moulier Boutang, as cited at the beginning of the article. Autonomy can no longer be thought of as an attribute or a quality inherent to migration. Just as the forms and practices of migration are shaped by, and can therefore not be separated from, the conditions under which they occur, the emergence of moments of autonomy can not be thought independently of the ever-more pervasive and intrusive governmental technologies that seek to control and regulate migration. Autonomy has to be rethought as a relational concept. Ranabir Samaddar’s proposal to read autonomy as ‘the “Other” of governmentality’ might offer a promising starting point for this task. 114 While it is beyond the scope of this article to rethink the autonomy of migration, it should be underscored that this is an endeavour that is both worthwhile and pertinent. Not only because the CAM’s reading of borders as sites of intensive political struggle over the selective denial and direct appropriation of mobility is well equipped to counter the growing de politicisation of border controls. Nor only because the CAM’s conception of borders as conflictive encounters avoids a control-biased analysis that confirms the claims that drive the technologisation of border controls. But also, and most importantly, because the insight of the renowned migration scholar Stephen Castles, whereupon potential migrants ‘do not decide to stay put just because the receiving state says they are not welcome’, is still valid in the context of technologically ever-more sophisticated border regimes. 115 In other words, the question of how moments of autonomy of migration emerge and persist becomes even more pertinent in the face of attempts to diminish migrants’ room for manoeuvre by turning their bodies into a means of mobility control.

EURODAC stores the fingerprints of apprehended border crossers and asylum seekers in order to facilitate the implementation of the Dublin II regulation, which stipulates that asylum seekers have to lodge their application in the member state through which they have entered the EU. Yet, EURODAC is also increasingly used for the re-identification of irregular migrants, thereby resembling a prime example of ‘function creep’, that is, the usage of databases for purposes beyond initially stated objectives.

Since multi-sited research is based on a radical constructivism, neither the object of inquiry nor the field of study are regarded as pre-given, but emerge in the research process. As ‘the object of the study is thought of as mobile and multiply situated’, the endeavour of multi-sited research lies – in this case – in tracing and tracking migrants’ encounters with border controls across and within multiple sites.

Benjamin Muller has, for instance, criticised the representation of biometric technologies as a side effect-free solution to balance the alleged tension between security and freedom of movement. The usage of biometric technologies in conjunction with the related risk management approach implicates, however, that unrestricted mobility is only available to those who make themselves completely transparent to border control authorities, as security is equated with visibility. Muller, Security, Risk , 95. Along similar lines, Didier Bigo argues that the technologisation of border controls ultimately translates freedom of movement into ever-more pervasive dataveillance. Didier Bigo, ‘Freedom and Speed in Enlarged Borderzones’, in The Contested Politics of Mobility: Borderzones and Irregularity , ed. Vicki Squire (Oxon and New York: Routledge, 2011). Moreover, numerous scholars in critical security studies have criticised that the discriminatory effects of border controls become concealed, but nevertheless persist and even intensify, in the context of biometric rebordering. I discuss this point in detail in the next section. 42. Bigo, ‘Security and Immigration’. 43.

Template refers to digital representations of particular biometric characteristics, which are generated by means of algorithms. These templates can be stored, exchanged, searched and matched by computers, which fulfil these tasks much faster and more efficiently than human beings, thereby allowing for the move from human to automated border controls. The crucial innovation lies, then, not so much in the usage of biometric characteristics for the verification of a person’s claimed identity, but in the move from analogous information (photography of people’s faces in passports or a simple ink fingerprint) to digital information.

In the end, trusted traveller programmes intensify the controls not only for those categorised as ‘high risk’, but also for the ‘trusted travellers’ themselves as a biometric passport and ‘background checks of varying range of intrusiveness’ are preconditions for the participation in such a scheme.

The aim of this paper is to analyse and evaluate the development of the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice. The development process of these systems is not more than their integration into the so-called IT Agency. This new regulatory agency was established in January 2012. It has merged the operational management tasks of the further developed version of SIS (the SIS II), VIS and EURODAC and it is flexible to add other existing and potential new systems. Hence, the added-value of the IT Agency is to be assessed, since new technologies shall be harnessed to meet the requirements of enhancing security and facilitating travel at the external borders.","facilitate travel; information power; large-scale IT systems; Schengen; security deficit",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dóczi, Z.; Corvinus University of Budapest, Közraktár u. 4-6, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary",,,12162574,,,,"English","Acta Juridica Hung.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878434229

Self-affirmation theory suggests that human expert users could be experiencing threat, causing them to act defensively and ignore the system's conflicting recommendations. Previous research has demonstrated that affirming an individual in an unrelated area reduces defensiveness and increases objectivity to conflicting information. Using an affirmation manipulation prior to a credibility assessment task, this study investigated if experts are threatened by counterattitudinal expert system recommendations. For our study, 178 credibility assessment experts from the American Polygraph Association (n = 134) and the European Union's border security agency Frontex (n = 44) interacted with a deception detection expert system to make a deception judgment that was immediately contradicted. Reducing the threat prior to making their judgments did not improve accuracy, but did improve objectivity toward the system. This study demonstrates that human experts are threatened by advanced expert systems that contradict their expertise. As more and more systems increase integration of artificial intelligence and inadvertently assail the expertise and abilities of users, threat and self-evaluative concerns will become an impediment to technology acceptance. © 2013 M.E.

The current retrofitting and technological remediation of borders suggests their transformation away from static demarcators of hard territorial boundaries toward much more sophisticated, flexible, and mobile devices of tracking, filtration, and exclusion. Borders require the labor of software developers, designers, engineers, infrastructure builders, border guards, systems experts, and many others who produce the ""smart border""; but they also depend on the labor of ""data-ready"" travelers who produce themselves at the border, as well as the underground labor of those who traffic in informal and illegalized economies across such borders. Bordering increasingly relies on technological forms of mediation that are embedded within hi-tech, military and private corporate logics, but are also resisted by electronic and physical ""hacks"" or bypassing of informational and infrastructural architectures. In this paper we consider three socio-technological assemblages of the border, and the labor which makes and unmakes them: (1) the interlocking ""cyber-mobilities"" of contemporary airports including visual technologies for baggage, cargo, and passenger inspection, as well as information technologies for passenger dataveillance, air traffic control, and human resource systems; (2) the development of the Schengen Information System database of the EU, and its implications for wider migrant rights and internal mobility within the EU, as well as radical border media that have attempted to intervene in that border space; and (3) elements of the US-Mexico ""smart border"" regime known as the Secure Border Initiative Network (2006-2011), and those who have tried to tactically evade, disrupt, or undermine the working of this border. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","bio-informatics; mobility; security; smart border; tactical media",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Vukov, T.; Department of Communication, , Quebec, Canada; email: tamara.vukov@umontreal.ca",,,10350330,,,,"English","Soc.

The rise of private involvement in border control can be seen as a subset of the migration industry, alongside, and sometimes interacting with, other subsets like facilitating or rescue services relating to migratory movement (see Introduction). At the outset, it is argued that the European borders are not static geographic phenomena, but rather borderscapes-that is, dynamic and multifaceted sites of interventions for public and private actors. These interventions can be conceptualized as processes of borderscaping, whereby the political, epistemological and physical elements of borders are dissolved, redefined and re-territorialized. The notion of borderscape contracts is suggested as a way of highlighting the role played by PSCs in these processes. Some examples of PSC borderscape contracts are examined. These include the UK Border Agency’s outsourcing of border enforcement functions to G4S, Finmeccanica’s role in the construction of Libyan border control capacities and PSC involvement in the European external border surveillance system (EUROSUR) project’s numerous advanced borders projects. It is argued that PSC’s role in externalization1 and their development of new, advanced technologies securitizes and thus transforms the day-to-day governance of the European borders. This, in turn, leads to serious questions regarding the opaqueness of borderscape budgets, lock-in effects making it difficult for public actors to reverse PSC militarization of borders and the humanitarian consequences of this for migrants. The chapter conceptualizes this development as cases of neoliber-alization2-that is, systemic shifts in the logic guiding public-private relations, which result in the inclusion of PSCs into the forums designing the European borderscapes.3 It is argued that PSC lobbyism through formal and informal forums reinforces a market dynamic where the industrial suppliers of border control technologies create a demand for their products in order to facilitate these systemic shifts. Some examples include the European Organization for Security (EOS), and the Frontex Agency’s Research and Development (R&amp;D) Unit’s cooperation with PSCs on drones for border control. Moreover, several “blurred” public/private EU forums, like the European Security Research Advisory Board (ESRAB) and the European Security Research and Innovation Forum (ESRIF), have been granted a large influence on the formulation of the European Union’s (EU) priorities on security research. One notable outcome, it is ventured, has been increased EU subsidies to PSC research into high-tech borderscapes exemplifying how PSCs are involved in the multileveled governance of the European borderscapes. The chapter suggests that the financial flows underpinning PSC bor-derscaping back to powerful financial actors, like the international banking sector, investment management firms and EU member states’ export credit agencies (ECAs). The activities of these actors, it is argued, show that the militarization of Europe’s borders is grounded not only in a desire to prevent immigration, but also in European politics of supporting military and control exports with public funds, even if this leads to increased debt in especially developing countries.

This can be achieved only by a close collaboration between information systems of public administration bodies in mutual relations and in relations with natural persons and businesses. The prerequisite is achieving the interoperability between the systems. Interoperable, basic infrastructural services (secure communication between administration bodies, cross-border access to files), common specifications, guidelines for interoperability and reusable software are the basic factors in an effective electronic administration. Works are underway to adopt an updated version of European interoperability framework, support and popularize interoperable services of electronic administration, based on standards, open specifications and interfaces. The paper presents the conception of interoperability and standardization of ubiquitous systems e-Government in the European Union member states. It defines the term ""interoperability"". It discusses three levels of assessing interoperability: technology, systems and tasks. The interoperability standards are considered in three aspects: technical, organizational and semantic. Examples of the European Union countries with the most developed interoperability frameworks are provided. There is an overview of e-services in e-Government ubiquitous systems in Poland as well as examples of using interoperability to deliver e-services online. In order to examine the functionality of e- Government ubiquitous information systems, we reviewed the systems offered by the public administration sector in Poland for delivering e-services in e-Administration.

The central concern of the article is how these technologies of extraterritorialisation, as deployed by the state, function to constitute regimes of statist visuality that produce both symbolic and physical forms of violence for their target subjects. In the course of the article, I critically examine the European Union’s EUROSUR project, Frontex and its Eurodac system and Australia’s Migration Legislation Amendment (Identification and Authentication) Act 2004 in order to stage a comparison of the various modalities of statist visuality deployed by states in their biopolitical governance of irregular migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, and to bring into critical focus the often lethal effects of these regimes of statist visuality. I conclude by presenting a form of counter-visuality to the state’s way of seeing by discussing the work of the contemporary Moroccan-French visual artist Bouchra Khalili, whose Mapping Journey Project stands as an agentic resignification and reclamation of the fraught journeys of irregular migrants through the surveilled lands of the global North. © 2015 Routledge.

The provision of SAT-AIS data can bring added value to existing maritime information services. SAT-AIS will assist European entities and institutions in law enforcement, fisheries control campaigns, maritime border control operations, and maritime safety and security, including marine pollution response, search and rescue and anti-piracy. The European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) are jointly working on setting up elements to maximise the provision and utilisation of SAT-AIS data and services. Within its Advanced Research in Telecommunications Systems (ARTES) programme, ESA, together with private partners, is working on the implementation of SAT-AIS small satellites, technologies, applications and services. EMSA and ESA have implemented a SAT-AIS Data Processing Centre (DPC) through a joint project, which is currently in the demonstration phase. The DPC forms part of the Integrated Maritime Data Environment (IMDatE) at EMSA, which has been recently developed to enhance the operational maritime services. One example for these services is the successful EMSA Blue Belt pilot project, which promotes and facilitates short sea shipping in the European Union by reducing the administrative burden for intra-Community trade. The use of SAT-AIS data helped customs to benefit from an added degree of certainty with regard to ship's voyage when ships were transiting outside the range of shore based AIS coverage. The achievements of the on-going SAT-AIS activities, including the SAT-AIS implementation projects for a novel receiver and micro-satellites, as well as the new ESA-EMSA SAT-AIS data service developments, are summarized in the following paper. ©2013 by the International Astronautical Federation.

Since 2005, the EU made the strategic choice of developing an independent European Earth observation capacity to deliver services in the environmental and security fields, called Global Monitoring for Environment and Security -GMES-. To develop the ""S"" of security, ESA has (i) pondered a security observation needs technology roadmap, based on existing assets and gaps, (ii) assessed options for a combined EO non-EO data access infrastructure in supply of EU security needs, (iii) explored the relevant concepts of operation of such system of systems for security purposes and (iv) defined relevant architectures and detailed observation requirements and means. This paper presents the security EO requirements envisaged by GMV in support of EU external actions, law enforcement and Schengen surveillance, together with the technical solution for a dual coordinated data access in the short, medium and long term (2015, 2020, 2025). The technical solution for the GMES-Security (GMES-S) dual data access system is conceived to deliver EO information for security applications to a wide range of European, National, and Regional organizations across the EU. Security products are increasingly demanding in terms of resolution -better than lm-, responsiveness -better than several hours from request to delivery-, and frequency. The most demanding needs originate in joint operations for crisis response, which require the fastest responsiveness. Fulfilment of required capabilities is reached through the deployment of dedicated assets (e.g. bespoke security EO satellites). The proposed ground segment includes the necessary elements to support these missions and achieve the necessary performances. It combines all present and future European ground or space missions. Combination of these assets is the key driver, shaping the GMES-S system of systems concept; the gap analysis shows that standalone satellite missions are far from providing the necessary performances for security purposes. The solution focuses on interoperability and scalability, enabling the highest level of cooperation in terms of committed assets versus obtained products/services. GMES-S dual data access system should motivate countries hosting strategic assets, since it provides a gain for National interests while it builds up a European service system with high performances, without the fear of losing strategic advantage. Finally, the proposed ground segment includes the necessary elements to allow the wide-spread geographical access to system capabilities at the European, National, and Regional level, whilst ensuring data/systems security, confidentiality, and integrity.

The regime is defined by a combination of three features: (i) a harmonisation of categories among the EU/Schengen member states, (ii) a growing use of new technology in networked databases and (iii) an increasing sorting of individuals based on security concerns. Although none of these features is new, the combination gives a new impetus to the European border control regime. The article concludes that the Lisbon Treaty and the Stockholm programme consolidate and strengthen existing trends. This implies that policies on border control, asylum, immigration, judicial cooperation and police cooperation are consolidated in a broader approach to border control, and that there is a strengthening of EU foreign policy within the European border control regime. The boundaries between previously dispersed policy areas are blurred. The combination of different aspects of security and various levels of authority requires coordination of policies with substantially different goals, and goes beyond mere border control.","Border control; Databases; Global Approach to Migration; Schengen; Security; Stockholm programme; Treaty of Lisbon",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Takle, M.; Norwegian Social Research (Nova)Norway",,,1815347X,,,,"English","J.

We could label these discourses as neo-orientalist because of their willingness to refer to the (often Muslim) migrant as a savage, uncivilized, terrorist 'other'; in the words of Sartori, as an 'anti-citizen'. This article reflects how citizenship, following a contemporary logic of orientalism, has become a set of guidelines, discourses, practices and policies for the governance of migration. Indeed, these are the guidelines through which neoliberal globalization liberalizes the free movement of citizens and 'westernized' foreign persons while deploying technologies of citizenship and border control against different subjects, regarded as eternal outsiders, or even aliens, because of their supposed incivility, threat or un-integrability. The ultimate purpose of this article is to argue that if we are to arrive at a model of citizenship beyond orientalism, there is a need to abandon the current orientation which inspires border and citizenship regimes. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","borders; citizenship; European Union; migrations; orientalism","citizenship; European Union; governance approach; guideline; immigrant population; immigration policy; legislative implementation; Orientalism; Europe","Open University, OU; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7; European Research Council, ERC: 249379; Eusko Jaurlaritza; Ikerbasque, Basque Foundation for Science","The research leading to these results is framed in the project Oecumene: citizenship after orientalism, funded by the European Research Council under the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007–2013) / ERC grant agreement no. 249379.

The number of border management tools has substantially expanded and includes simple fences and more sophisticated optical and electro-optical sensors, information technology (IT) intrusion detection systems, biometrical and patterns sensors and systems, manned and unmanned aircrafts, as well as intelligent surveillance means. Altogether, the border management security market amounts to C22 billion in the US and C10 billion in Europe. In addition, a multitude of ‘stakeholders’ has largely expanded to include not only traditional border management actors (e.g. the DG Justice and the DG Home Affairs in the European Commission, Interpol, Europol or the Customs Cooperation Working Party), but also the European Union AntiFraud Office (OLAF), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) programme, the Joint Research Centre (JRC), the European Union Satellite Centre (EUSC), the European Defence Agency (EDA) or the European Security Research and Innovation Forum (ESRIF). Operational cooperation on border management is mostly structured around the activities of the European Patrol Network and the External Borders Agency Frontex (joint operations, Focal Points, Rapid Border Intervention Teams, risk analysis, training, technical assistance to Member States), which is the focus of the next chapter. The implementation of these measures is supported through the use of burden-sharing tools like the Schengen Facility (e.g. C400 million for Romania and Bulgaria in 2007-2009) and the External Border Fund, which amounts to C1.82 billion for the period 2007-2013, the major part of which is distributed among Member States depending on their burden regarding external border controls and visa policy. Several new legislative proposals are in the making concerning, among others, the amendment of the Schengen Borders Code, setting up an Entry Exit System (EES) and a Registered Traveller Programme (RTP), as well as the start of operations of the Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ). These developments give rise to an intricate system for the defence of the EU’s realm where the construction of the border depends on its dislocation, both political and spatial. The three clusters of border policy repertoires described in this chapter, surveillance, smart borders and integrated border management, epitomise the emerging practice the EU has engaged in. They reflect the ‘pushing-out of borders’ in two distinctive ways: through technological devices and a particular relationship with the neighbour. The latter relies on attempts to prevent the border-related threat from entering the EU’s realm by shifting increasing responsibility to contain it onto the neighbour. This move is accompanied by conditionality (e.g. the pressure towards readmission tied with the promises of visa facilitation) and the projection of the EU political and social model geared at a systemic reform of the neighbour. A quote from the EU Internal Security Strategy (ISS) reflects the rationale underpinning this logic: ‘The quality of our democracy and public confidence in the Union will depend to a large extent on our ability to guarantee security and stability in Europe and to work with our neighbours and partners to address the root causes of the internal security problems faced by the EU’ (European Council 2010b: 9). Here the externally assisted reform, most explicitly in our case integrated border management and security sector reform, turn into modern state-building.1. © 2012 Selection and editorial material, Christian Kaunert, Sarah Léonard and Patryk Pawlak.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Taylor and Francis",,9781136332777; 9780415677943,,,"English","European Homeland Security: A European Strategy in the Mak.?",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123146228

The need to ‘harmonize’ national asylum policies in the EU arose due to the lifting of internal border controls between most EU Member States through the Schengen Free Travel Accord (1985) (Kopp 2002: 51f; see also Walters 2002). So far, this harmonization has involved a number of legal instruments covering issues such as which Member State is responsible for hearing an asylum claim (according to the ‘one state only principle’), the procedures to be used in reviewing the asylum claim, and the living conditions of asylum-seekers pending a decision (Kopp 2002: 51ff). The Common European Asylum System (European Commission Home Affairs 2011) has not eliminated differences in the way Member States treat asylum-seekers and refugees. Member States are united, however, in their determination to defend the EU against unwanted immigrants and refugees. The continent has been turned into a ‘fortress’. In 2004, a European Union agency for external border security was founded: Frontex, 5 equipped with about 113 vessels, 26 helicopters, 22 fixed-wing aircrafts and modern surveillance and detection technologies to combat ‘illegal’ immigration (Leonard 2011: 16). It is responsible for coordinating the activities of the national border guards to ensure the security of the EU’s borders with non-Member States. It has been widely criticized by NGOs and the European Church Asylum Movement since its operations block asylum-seekers from claiming protection under the 1951 Refugee Convention: The militarizing of Europe’s outer borders, the practically unfulfillable [sic] conditions for legal entry and repulsive living conditions for immigrants continue to be a system abhorrent toward refugees. The attempt to find protection in our countries has cost the lives of thousands. In our society, however, reports on refugees drowning in the Mediterranean, suffocating in containers, or taking their own lives in deportation centers are met by what Hanna Arendt called ‘the curse of indifference’. © 2013 Randy K.

Still, apart from 'technicalities', their use and design are generally assumed as politics-free. On the contrary, this contribution brings technologies to the forefront of the research and reframes them in terms of socio-technical assemblages. From this perspective, it analyses the role of the 2011 EU Passenger Name Record project in the making of European security and its external dimension. The lesson learned is that human institutions are neither the only players nor the passive victims of technological determinisms.

The European Union (EU) has been particularly successful in promoting its approaches internationally despite the potentially negative impact of these technologies on civil liberties and fundamental freedoms.This article investigates why, despite a clear divergence between the EU's declarations and practice in balancing fundamental freedoms and security, the EU has faced little external criticism regarding its extraterritorial instruments. In the case of EU-US relations, the EU managed to optimize the outcome of the Passenger Name Record (PNR) negotiations by using the security-oriented US legislation as a pretext for advancing its own security-dominated agenda. At the same time, the EU managed to avoid criticism from the United States and international civil society regarding its flagship projects like the'border package'or the creation of large-scale IT systems for collecting and processing personal information. In its relations with candidate countries, the EU has managed to escape criticism due to several factors: weak data protection institutions in those countries, different priorities set by the accession process, and rather weak civil society organizations (CSOs) dependent on EU funding. In the absence of external actors challenging the EU approach, recourse to the international judicial bodies is the last resort for taking action in this regard.This article argues that inconsistency and contradiction between the EU's various policy approaches has contributed to the unintentional development of an external governance model that maximizes the EU's position internationally. © 2012 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.",,,"Erzincan Üniversitesi; European Commission; Erzincan Üniversitesi; Information-Technology Promotion Agency","There is also limited involvement on the part of the civil society organizations (CSOs), which usually complement the role of state organs. The role of civil society in enhancing fundamental rights, notably privacy, in those countries is growing but still limited. It is complicated for several reasons. The Commission Progress Report for Croatia presented in 2010 observed that while CSOs play a crucial role in promoting democracy and human rights, they have very limited access to policymaking.This is related to several factors. First, the enlargement is a major objective of those countries and their main interest lies with the pre-accession process that pushes other objectives down the agenda and focuses more on institution building and the efficiency of the process. At the same time, their operational capabilities are substantially compromised by insufficient funding and extensive dependence on external sources of funding.59 For instance, the European Commission pointed out in its progress report for Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), that ‘civil society organizations remain heavily dependent on foreign funding and the lack of sufficient financial resources remains a serious constraint’.60The funding provided by the EU to CSOs under the Transition Assistance and Institution Building component of the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance varies depending on the country concerned.Whereas in","Privacy International, ‘European Privacy and Human Rights in 2010’, <www.privacyinternational .org>. In the candidate countries (i.e., Croatia, FYROM, Turkey), the EU funding provided through different national and regional horizontal Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) programmes with the Civil Society Facility is a major instrument for the support and development of civil society.

The European Border Surveillance System, EUROSUR, is supposed to be operational by October 2013, and will enable the Member States to share surveillance data, with the aim of improving the coordination of their responses. The initiative is driven by political motivations (reducing irregular migration into Europe), security objectives (preventing cross-border crime) and a more humanitarian aim (to reduce the death toll at sea among migrants seeking to cross the Mediterranean), with an overarching belief in surveillance technologies as the ultimate way to solve these issues. By virtually pushing the effective border of the EU further out, this future surveillance system however raises a range of legal and ethical dilemmas. This article analyzes the discourse legitimating the need for a more robust surveillance capability at the external borders of the EU, by looking at what can be qualified as the main ""drivers"", but also the main points of contention, or ""obstacles"", in the process of establishing such a system. It argues that the fundamental belief in surveillance technologies as the ultimate tool to solve the challenges at play along the external border of the EU is such that it only meets the geographical obstacles and legal and ethical dilemmas with a call for more surveillance and more information sharing.","Border control; EUROSUR; Frontex; Maritime space; Mediterranean; Migration; Non-refoulement; Search and rescue","border region; ethics; European Union; immigration policy; internal migration; political border; population migration; regional security; surveillance and enforcement; Europe",,,,,,,,,,,,"Jumbert, M.G.; Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO), P.O.

First, there are good reasons to believe the approach is not enabling the authorities to deter identified border threats. Second, the approach is contributing to a border management regime that is having an increasingly divergent impact on the mobility and life chances of different groups and populations. In conclusion, it is suggested the inefficacy of the approach is due to contradictions and blind spots embedded in policy maker's approaches to security issues.

The challenge facing international actors fighting terror and Organized Crime (OC) is twofold: how to better inspect the movement of persons and still impose as little inconvenience on the travelers as possible. This paper deals with the formal and intelligence dimensions: travel documents and their makeup, the border crossing travel documents inspection and the sharing of information among concerned parties. The following discussion deals with some of the more acute areas in this field and offers a model designed to further narrow down the net and yet admitting that it will only add to the necessary security but will not produce the ultimate solution. After observing some of the current pitfalls of the system the paper presents the concept of a credit card size electronic digital passport. The idea is not new, however since it is not yet in use this is the time to characterize the product. Therefore, perhaps the initial element, the one which involves decision on cabinet level should be that all citizens must carry one official identification document. That move will obviously contribute to enhanced security. The only difference between an ID/ED passport and a credit card is not in its appearance, but in its contents. It hides a radio frequency identification, or RFID, chip and many counter forfeiting elements. It is unique in that it is a driver's license, national ID and a national passport at the same time. It does not only say that on the cover and back of the card but it includes on its chip all the necessary data. This card, given the authority in charge, can be read and enact different types of mechanism: the police officer's cruising car terminal, a voting machine, a passport control terminal etc. Obviously, the encryption procedure and the access protocols are distinctive for each level. However, access to changing the contents should be encrypted in a way that several authorities may have access to their own information but never to any other information entered by other bodies. This approach will undoubtedly make forging travel documents expensive and time consuming beyond the usual means of most terror and OC organizations. Moreover, on top of safeguarding the re-writing process the data should be protected by security features embedded in the software and unknown to the officer feeding the machine with the necessary details. Many current national travel documents depend on two elements: a bulky paper document and an RFID chip. The desired end result proposed here will be a new concept of a travel document: a small multipurpose card. The technology alluded to in this paper does exist. Moreover, it is partially in use in the present. It is a matter of further developing the abilities of the embryonic software and integrating many elements into one system.","Border control; Intelligence; Interpol; Organized crime; Passport; Schengen; Terror; WHTI","Border control; Intelligence; Interpol; Passport; Schengen; Terror; WHTI; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Crime",,,,,,,,,,,,"Bligh, A.; Ariel University Center, Ariel, Israel; email: abligh@nd.edu",,,,9781622765355,,,"English","Eur.

However, despite hundreds of thousands of fingerprints being processed through this system each year, Eurodac has received only very little media attention. In Europe, much of the public debate about the use of biometric technologies for the purpose of automated personal identification is centered on the gradual introduction of new biometric passports. To view biometric systems as "" black boxes "" leads to erroneous conclusions about their effectiveness, both from a technophobic and a technophile point of view. Rather, on a technical, socio-economic and historical level, they should be understood as complex systems that integrate smaller computer systems which are being sold to state and private actors by different manufacturers. The use of biometric identification systems at national borders can be seen as being part of communicative processes in the negotiation of access to resources and power. And the technology itself is a disputatious actor not least because of its unavoidable measurement errors (though categorizable) and unpredictable interactions with human actors.

When Information & Communication Technologies (ICT) are involved, outsourcing becomes rather complex. In such cases, a clear definition of the processes to be implemented and a quality assurance monitoring system are crucial factors for success. In addition, globalization, world level financial instability and the need to adjust to evolving standards and requirements, compel Governments and Public Organizations to become more adaptable and to handle changes efficiently. This last constraint has a direct impact on the design of ICT systems; Business Process Modeling becomes mandatory as the most appropriate change management mechanism. In this paper, a new methodology is presented based on Business Process Modeling. Once the model is completed, the relative program code of the final system is produced. In addition to this system, an end-to-end monitoring platform is developed to continuously search, identify and assess technical and human deficiencies. This goal is achieved by following-up the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the processes, through the creation and management of adequate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Once the technical problems are suitably addressed, the focus moves to human skills and competency. In this case, clearly defined training needs can be covered adequately and the system can be used optimally. This new methodology has already been tested successfully on a simple Bank application, a short description of which is included in this paper. The next step is to apply the methodology on N-VIS, the Greek National Visa Information System that is responsible for the exchange of visa application data between the Greek Authorities and the Schengen Member States. © 2010 IEEE.","BPEL; BPMN; KPI; Visa","Application data; Business process modeling; Change management; Communication technologies; Direct impact; End-to-end monitoring; European Union; Human skills; Key performance indicators; Member state; Monitoring system; Program code; Public organizations; Public sector; Public-sector projects; Technical problem; Visa information systems; Information technology; Machine design; Outsourcing; Quality assurance; Quality control; Quality of service; Total quality management; Benchmarking",,,,,,,,,,,,"Loumos, V.; National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece; email: loumos@cs.ntua.gr",,,,9780769539843,,,"English","ITNG - Int.

These are more than simple responses to stricter migration controls and are associated with related developments in technology and communications. They are therefore a structural change in migration systems which require a re-examination of the ways in which protection is offered to migrants. This has become an important theme of international discussion since 2005 but the humanitarian situation of international migrants on particular routes remains of concern to aid groups and many in the international community. This paper, based on research in Morocco, considers the protection needs of three groups of 'stranded' migrants: yet to be recognized refugees, previously recognized refugees and those with other protection needs. It examines migration histories to identify reasons why this third group of individuals may be unable or unwilling to return and the nature of humanitarian assistance they require. © The Author 2010.

In this new system of controls, the focus is less on the physical crossing of territorial borders and more on the process as a whole; from airline reservations, ticketing and visa applications to monitoring individuals after arriving in the country of destination. The developing mode of border control encompasses a multiplication of borders, a multiplication of actors and a multiplication of data and technology. The question arises: Does the new form of border management in Western countries bring forward the aims of border control more effectively and does it entail new risks (for visitors/migrants)? In this article I will first outline a normative framework for evaluating current developments in border control, building on studies in political theory and the philosophy of law. I then substantiate my claim that a new type of border control is developing and present an overview of three interconnected multiplications. Next, using findings from empirical and legal studies, (likely) consequences of the multiplications will be presented. Linking these consequences to the normative framework allows us, finally, to point out risks of the currently developing system of border control. Points for practitioners In recent decades Western countries have introduced new measures of border control, including new technologies and new types of agents in new roles. Together, these new measures make for a new type of global border control management. Our evaluation of this development shows that it entails new types of risks, and that these risks are likely to increase if this type of management develops further along the same lines. This analysis calls for a reorientation on instruments of border control leading to a more encompassing type of risk management in this field. © The authors, 2010.","E-government; Evaluation; Implementation; International administration; Networks","administration; government; implementation process; political border; political development; risk assessment; territorial management; Australia; Europe; North America",,,,,,,,,,,,"Tholen, B.; Public Administration Department, Netherlands",,,00208523,,,,"English","Int.

The twin issues ofdata protection and data security within what was the EU’s third pillar legal framework thereforecome to the fore. With the Lisbon Treaty reform of the EU, and the increased role of the Commissionin PJCCM policy areas, and the integration of the PJCCM provisions with what have traditionallybeen the pillar I activities of Frontex, the opportunity for streamlining the data protection and datasecurity provisions of the law enforcement bodies of the post-Lisbon EU arises. This is recognisedby the Commission in their drafting of an amending regulation for Frontex2, when they say thatthey would prefer “to return to the question of personal data in the context of the overall strategyfor information exchange to be presented later this year and also taking into account the reflectionto be carried out on how to further develop cooperation between agencies in the justice and homeaffairs field as requested by the Stockholm programme.”3 The focus of the literature published onthis topic, has for the most part, been on the data protection provisions in Pillar I, EC. While thefocus of research has recently sifted to the previously Pillar III PJCCM provisions on data protection,4a more focused analysis of the interlocking issues of data protection and data security needs to bemade in the context of the law enforcement bodies, particularly with regard to those which werebased in the pre-Lisbon third pillar. This paper will make a contribution to that debate, arguing thata review of both the data protection and security provision post-Lisbon is required, not only inorder to reinforce individual rights, but also inter-agency operability in combating cross-border EUcrime. The EC’s provisions on data protection, as enshrined by Directive 95/46/EC, do not apply tothe legal frameworks covering developments within the third pillar of the EU. Even CouncilFramework Decision 2008/977/JHA, which is supposed to cover data protection provisions withinPJCCM expressly states that its provisions do not apply to “Europol, Eurojust, the SchengenInformation System (SIS)” or to the Customs Information System (CIS). In addition, the post Treaty ofPrüm provisions covering the sharing of DNA profiles, dactyloscopic data and vehicle registrationdata pursuant to Council Decision 2008/615/JHA, are not to be covered by the provisions of the2008 Framework Decision. As stated by Hijmans and Scirocco, the regime is “best defined as apatchwork of data protection regimes”, with “no legal framework which is stable and unequivocal,like Directive 95/46/EC in the First pillar”.5 Data security issues are also key to the sharing of data in organised crime or counterterrorism situations. This article will critically analyse the current legalframework for data protection and security within the third pillar of the EU. © 2010, Journal of Contemporary European Research.

The changing international security environment and the emergence of asymmetric and non-conventional threats in SEE created the need for a regional approach to develop common plans and strategies through enhancing coordination among the different security agencies. This initiative fully supports current international efforts to promote CBSC in SEE, taking also into account other initiatives in the region sponsored by the UN, EU, NATO and OSCE. Since the establishment of the CBSC WG, the WG members participated in a lot of activities including a number of relevant seminars and conferences organised by SEDM nations, and they also push forward measures to improve transparency and visibility of the WG, by opening up to cooperation with other organisations and processes. The main threat today undoubtedly is CBRN terrorism. International terrorism includes spreading of WMD technology and expertise. WMD information is widely accessible and highly-trained engineers and physicists employed spreading throughout the world. Organised and general international crimes include the smuggling of WMD and related material, dual-use goods and transfers of NBC technologies, equipment, agents and knowledge.","Global proliferation threat; Practical levels of non-proliferation policy; Scientific and technical realities; Threats posed by cbrn terrorism; Treaties and agreements towards cbrn","biological weapon; border region; chemical weapon; environmental legislation; European Union; global perspective; international agreement; international relations; NATO; nuclear weapon; radioactivity; security threat; terrorism; United Nations; weaponry; Europe",,,,,,,,,,,,"Bokan, S.13 Brune Busica Street, HR-10 000 Zagreb, Croatia; email: slavkobokan@hotmail.com",,,13115065,,,,"English","J.

Increasingly people have little control over their own information and this is the real challenge facing organisations and governments in an era of exponential creation, networking and duplication of data, most of which is identifiable in nature. Traditionally, identity management has been considered as the process of managing information for a person's interaction with an organization's information systems and assets. Nowadays, there is a key fundamental business shift away from the traditional approach in which a user's identity was managed manually on a system-by-system basis. Federated identity management, which supports multiple entities connected within a circle of trust, is one of the major initiatives growing out of Web services that will provide substantial benefits to corporations and consumers. Federated identity management (IDM) refers to the ability to establish trust relationships between various security domains to enable the passing of authentication, authorization and privacy assertions. This is a key aspect of identity management in the context of business-to-business integration, typically when Web services technology is used. The European Union is actively pursuing an interoperable pan-European e-IDM since 2006. Under this initiative, EU governments have agreed to facilitate, as a matter of high priority, the establishment for mutual recognition of national electronic identities for public administration Web sites and services. The key reason for promoting the interoperability of e-identification is the growth of demand for cross-border services, which needs to be met by equivalent crossborder framework of cooperation. Once this initiative reaches a good level of success and an acceptable maturity level, it could possibly prove the model for a worldwide interoperable e-identification system, increasing the efficiency of transactions, and significantly enhancing the effectiveness of border control systems. © 2010 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

This greediness indicates the distorting potential of information technology regarding the means-end logic. Our analysis suggests that the European migration policy is stuck in a 'digital fix', i.e. a technological fix focusing on ICT. We identify three political issues concerning greedy information technology within the context of the European migration policy. The first issue concerns the democratic control on information systems. The second issue discusses the weak legal position of immigrants.

The objective of this ""border monitoring"" assessment is to contribute to the development of scenarios on potential future migration through land borders and to develop recommendations for border management. This study begins with an assessment of statistical and earth observation information datasets to monitor border crossing in real time. Due to the unavailability of relevant data, this study evolved towards an indirect definition of migrants' likelihood to cross the border (the border permeability). The permeability model combines earth observation and geo-spatial technologies with formal decision theory to assess the likelihood that a border area may be crossed by an illegal migrant, based on a presumed cost/opportunity behavioural strategy. Two preliminary permeability models were developed on two different areas, the EU-25 land border and the Central African region. The resulting permeability maps help in the overall understanding of illegal migration patterns. In the border monitoring process, they help to identify high permeability areas where change detection analysis can be carried out using medium resolution satellite imagery. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","geographical information system; Illegal migration; multi-criteria model; remote sensing; statistics",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Stephenne, N.; Institute for the Protection and Security of the Citizen, Via Fermi 1, 21020 Ispra, (VA), Italy; email: nathalie.stephenne@jrc.it",,"Springer Netherlands",,9781402084836,,,"English","Remote Sens. from Sp.: Support.

Paradoxically, what was seen as a key strength in defining the EU’s international presence is also regarded as its main weakness in terms of actorness. In this regard, some of the diplomats highlight how the distinction between high and low policies in EU external relations (Hoffmann 1966) contributes to delineating the EU role (JA2, SA1, ME3). Whereas some important competencies - such as international trade - are handled at the Community level, others - such as foreign policy, security and justice and home affairs - are conceived as standing firmly at the national level. The EU is generally described as an effective actor in those areas where there are clear delegated competencies at the Community level. In those areas, as we will see, the EU is seen to have a strong, undisputed role on the international scene (Figure 14.2). This is the case for international trade and technological development (IN2), but also for regulation, a sector in which the EU is said to play a powerful role, probably more so than the US (JA2, IS1, US3). However, this strong relevance is often criticized as way of maintaining a privileged economic position on the international scene. As put by a South African diplomat, the developing world tends to see the EU as protectionist bloc, which uses technical barriers in order to protect its market while promoting an official policy of tariff removals (SA1). According to an Indian diplomat, the powerful role that the EU plays in international trade affords it a disproportionate representation in the World Trade Organization (WTO), which brings into question the actual multilateral vocation of the EU itself (IN2). The EU is also blamed for not being particularly transparent in its regulatory processes (IS1, US3). Furthermore, over-regulation is not only seen as a tacit instrument of power, but also as a burden on other countries, which inevitably slows down international cooperation (AU1). © 2010 Selection and editorial matter, Sonia Lucarelli and Lorenzo Fioramonti; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Taylor and Francis",,9781135239497; 9780415481007,,,"English","External Perceptions of the European Union as a Global Actor",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123666759

Border confinement raises substantial issues about fundamental rights; it involves questions of legality and legitimacy, and the definition of new technologies of government. In France, the origins of border detention show how pre-existing administrative practices of detention were legalized through the adoption of ""waiting zones,"" a new regime of detention that enhanced both conditions of detention and disciplinary control over detainees. This development confronts human-rights activists who have opposed border detention since the mid-1970s with ""paradoxical gains"" and a tough dilemma: the rights that have been granted by the state to travellers held at the borders are not enough, whereas legalization has opened the way for new control mechanisms. Understanding border confinement involves analysing these paradoxes produced by constant negotiations between the administration, willing to tighten control over its borders, and concerns of certain groups within civil society, willing to defend basic rights and give a legal framework to control practices. In France, the diffusion of penitentiary models of management and the ambiguities of law that this article explores further draw together the conditions for administrative processes of legal exclusion. What do such processes teach us about evolving regimes of government within rights-based liberal systems?","Border control; Extraterritorial confinement; Legal mobilization; Undocumented aliens and asylum seekers in the EU",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Makaremi, C.; Département d'Anthropologie, CP 6128, Suce.

Incidental, snap-shot images find their application niches-among the existing technologies for ship monitoring-mostly in alerting to the presence of unknown targets and in surveying outlying areas. The main applications in the European seas cover fisheries control, pollution control and maritime border security, although operational use is still sporadic. The sensor of choice is SAR, because it allows ship detection over wide swaths and under many conditions. High-resolution optical sensors can provide additional information on ship classification, which is still difficult for SAR. Their narrow swaths, however, mostly limit their use to predetermined locations. Clutter from the sea surface hinders detection of the smallest ships, especially at high sea state, leading to false alarms and to less than 100% detection probability. For many applications these drawbacks can be kept within acceptable limits by proper choice of the swath width/reso-lution combination. Satellite sensors may also image ship wakes, from which information on ship speed and heading can be gleaned. Crucial to operational use is the ability for automatic analysis. This is relatively well developed for ship detection, and less well for classification and wake analysis, in SAR images, and quite immature for optical images. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Greidanus, H.; Joint Research Centre, , Ispra, Italy",,"Springer Netherlands",,9781402067716,,,"English","Remote Sens. of the Europ.

It was noted in that Report that the existing problems in judicial and enforcement agencies’ cooperation across the EU made the use of national criminal records as a means of combating organised crime rather problematic. It was pointed out that practical problems hindered the speed, access and effectiveness of existing methods of cooperation and the creation and use of an ECR was the way forward for the effective combating of organised crime. Of course, the idea of using databases as a means of combating crime is not new. Practically all enforcement agencies around the world use ‘files’ (in paper or digital form) on crimes, suspects and methods (modus operandi) in an attempt to prevent crime or prosecute criminals. In fact, in recent years digital databases such as the Schengen Information System (SIS) have become the first line of defence against transnational organised crime and plans to update and develop further the system into a SIS II are on the way. What makes the proposal for an ECR different is the idea of an EU-wide dedicated database which addresses the problem directly: in other words, a dedicated database which contains information extracted from national criminal records on selected crimes. © Cambridge University Press 2008 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Stefanou, C.; Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, School of Advanced Studies, University of LondonUnited Kingdom",,"Cambridge University Press",,9780511495069; 9780521866699,,,"English","Towards a European Criminal Record",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927004727

Steps in this direction have taken the form of initiatives aiming both at eliminating obstacles to the exchange of personal data between national authorities and at creating EU-wide structures and databases. The emphasis on developing EU-wide databases can be witnessed in both the immigration and asylum field (with the establishment of the EURODAC and Schengen Information System (SIS) databases and proposals to establish a Visa Information System (VIS) in the pipeline) and the criminal law/policing field (the Europol database and part of the SIS database being prime examples). Political reactions to terrorist attacks this decade have led to calls for increasingly linking these databases (notwithstanding their different purpose) and increasing their ‘interoperability’ – a strategy clearly visible in the 2004 Hague Programme, a five-year renewal of the EU Justice and Home Affairs strategy. The Hague Programme also calls for the further facilitation of bilateral information exchanges in the police field under the so-called ‘principle of availability’ and for the ‘deepening’ of surveillance by the use of biometrics in the various databases. © Cambridge University Press 2008 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mitsilegas, V.; School of Law, Queen Mary, University of LondonUnited Kingdom",,"Cambridge University Press",,9780511495069; 9780521866699,,,"English","Towards a European Criminal Record",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84909422433

Specifically, I examine the expanding scope and implications of biometric surveillance technologies in liberal states’ border securitization practices. Since 9/11, biometric identification systems have been fast‐tracked as a “silver‐bullet solution” to address perceived threats to border security in the United States and the European Union. I argue that the deployment of new information and biometric technologies in the United States and the European Union is both individuating and expanding state space into new geographies (i.e., state control is extensifying inside bodies and reaching outside sovereign territorial boundaries). This is due, in part, to the deployment and growing interoperability of new border securitization technologies, like US‐VISIT in the United States and the second generation of the Schengen Information System (SIS II) and Visa Information System (VIS) in the European Union. Biometric systems augment efforts to create a high‐concept, multi‐layered, interoperable system of “virtual borders” designed to deter or intercept determined terrorists, criminals, and unauthorized migrants. As the deployment of biometric technologies creep from the margins to the mainstream, privacy and surveillance concerns will become evermore salient. Equally important are the implications of this incremental “disembodied integration” of people with states on how liberal bionetwork societies make decisions about belonging and exclusion. As virtual borders extend into our bodies and around the globe, securitization measures that intersect bodies and states require a virtual theory to account for these new geographies of state space and the qualitative affects on individuals. © 2007, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ross, J.C.; Department of Political Science, , Fort Collins, CO, United States",,,08865655,,,,"English","J.

Because borders and immigration policy alone cannot stop irregular migration, many governments turn to internal migration control on settled irregular migrants. Surveillance of this group is aimed at their exclusion from key societal institutions, discouraging their stay and ultimately, the deportation of apprehended irregular migrants. These are policies in which identification of irregular migrants is crucial. In this age, registration and identification mean computerized and networked databases. The member states of the EU are currently developing a network of databases in the field of (irregular) immigration. The Schengen Information System (II), the Eurodac database and the Visa Information System are vast databases, often including biometric data, aimed at controlling migration flows and identifying and sorting legal and irregular migrants. These systems are able to 're-identify' parts of the population of irregular migrants on the basis of digital traces of their migration history. It is argued that the digital infrastructure that is now growing past its infancy is developing into a formidable tool for the surveillance of irregular migrants in Europe. ©International Sociological Association.","Databases; European Union; Irregular migration; Social sorting; Surveillance",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Broeders, D.; Erasmus University of Rotterdam, Netherlands; email: broeders@fsw.eur.nl",,,02685809,,,,"English","Int.

Thus the information management as such becomes a very complex and costly issue. This paper presents an overview of the ORCHESTRA project. ORCHESTRA responds to European needs to develop a standardised, general purpose and generic information infrastructure for the management of environmental and risk management information and related cross-boundary business processes. ORCHESTRA was started in September 2004 and is funded under the 6th framework program of the EU (FP6), under the priority ""Improving Risk Management"" of the Information Society Technologies (IST) program. ORCHESTRA is a 14 million Euro project with 14 partners across Europe. ORCHESTRA is currently developing a general purpose concept for the integration of risk management information systems in Europe. With this, ORCHESTRA contributes to both the INSPIRE and GMES activities in Europe. The paper presents an overview of the project, introduces general problems in integrating crossboundary systems and gives an overview of the appraoch taken by ORCHESTRA. Part of this is the ORCHESTRA Reference Model, which will be the basis for all specification and implementation work undertaken. Note that this paper presents early results.

Now terrorism is not the only issue in the new security agenda, and we appear to have stopped rushing our legislative processes. Yet, policies are still emerging with a lack of public discourse and legislative deliberation. This article reviews two such policies: access to personal information held by airlines and new border practices that include the collection and processing of biometrics. By looking at the negotiations between the U.S. and the European Commission on passenger name records (PNR), the debates in Canada regarding the collection of passenger information, and the deployment of the US-VISIT system, we identify a number of policy dynamics. We can see within these dynamics of policy formation some essential ingredients for discourse and deliberation, which may inform future debates. In particular, this article argues that we may inform policy by looking at the international, regulatory, legal, and technological dynamics of policy. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The right to move freely represents one of the fundamental freedoms of the internal market as well as an essential political element of the package of rights linked to the very status of EU citizenship. The scope ratione personae and the current state of the principle of free movement of persons is assessed by looking at the most recent case law of the Court of Justice and the recently adopted Directive on the rights of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States. But what are the hidden and visible obstacles to free movement of persons in Europe? How can these barriers be overcome to make free movement and residence rights more inclusive? This article addresses these issues along with the following questions: Who are the beneficiaries of the free movement of persons in an enlarged Europe? What is the impact of the recent legal developments in the freedom of movement dimension, such as the European Court of Justice case law and the new Directive? And to what extent are pro-security policies such as the Schengen Information System II and an enhanced interoperability between European databases fully compatible with the freedom of movement paradigm?. © 2017 Wiley.

Finally, it suggests the development of a Global Agreement linking security and other maritime trade-related issues. The initiative for such an agreement should be undertaken by the EU only if current International Maritime Organisation (IMO) efforts fail to produce a maritime security framework with binding requirements and after the wider impact of US security measures has been properly assessed (Flynn, 2002). The September 11 events have revealed the soft underbelly of globalisation. The liberalisation of markets and the resulting facilitation of trade and travel allow terrorists to do their worst. Existing border-management architectures provide no guarantees that terrorists can be prevented from reaching their targets. Furthermore, market pressures are now forcing transport companies to embrace higher standards and adopt technologies and processes that can make border control less relevant. Preoccupation with the urgency of domestic security issues has encouraged the US to develop security standards and urge the rest of the world to adopt their approach or to engage in direct negotiations with them. The US approach is two-fold: it is based on the early detection and interception of terrorists (by moving control away from borders to points-of-origin) who seek to exploit or target the international transport networks coupled with cooperation on data gathering and information sharing.1 These two aspects have shaped US initiatives and legislations such as the Container Security Initiative (CSI) (US Customs 2002), the ‘Port and Maritime Security Act of 2001’ and the ‘Maritime Transportation Antiterrorism Act of 2002’.2 These two legislative Acts and the CSI initiative aim at enhancing security, while at the same time furthering US strategic interests in security-related trade issues and strengthening the US maritime industry's position in order to make it more competitive (Lloyd's List, February 2002). There is a need to study the wider implications of US maritime security initiatives and assess US intentions within the context of international maritime trade. US-driven maritime security initiatives and the current fragmentation of efforts of international organisations such as IMO, World Customs Organisation, International Labour Organisation, and International Standards Organisation, if are not checked by the international maritime community (through a global agreement), may ultimately enable the US to impose its requirements on the rest of the world and affect the operations of international shipping. There is no doubt that current efforts to secure new maritime security consensus through the IMO is a step in the right direction. The amended Chapter XI of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention and the Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS Code) although fundamental to a global security do not cover containers. However, given the multiplicity of actors involved, existing arrangements may not guarantee the required coordination in particular with the WCO. Furthermore, it is not certain that input from the various organisations with varying degrees of expertise will dovetail with IMO work already underway. In order to deal with the consequences and pitfalls of the US initiatives and cope with the fragmentation of international efforts, the development of a Global Agreement should be considered to weld all the stakeholders in a legally binding international framework. A Global Agreement may prove to be a much more cost-effective way of enhancing maritime security globally and restraining US ‘hegemonic’ ambitions and unilateralism in maritime trade. © 2003 Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.

The analysis illustrates those particular geopolitical and sociopolitical control imperatives that actually affect the efficiency of the Schengen Agreement in Greece.

Two main models of migration and incorporation dominated academic and policy approaches in the late twentieth century: first, the settler model, according to which immigrants gradually integrated into economic and social relations, re-united or formed families and eventually became assimilated into the host society (sometimes over two or three generations); second, the temporary migration model, according to which migrant workers stayed in the host country for a limited period, and maintained their affiliation with their country of origin. Globalization, defined as a proliferation of cross-border flows and transnational networks, has changed the context for migration. New technologies of communication and transport allow frequent and multi-directional flows of people, ideas and cultural symbols. The erosion of nation-state sovereignty and autonomy weakens systems of border-control and migrant assimilation. The result is the transformation of the material and cultural practices associated with migration and community formation, and the blurring of boundaries between different categories of migrants. These trends will be illustrated through case-studies of a number of Asian and European immigration countries. It is important to re-think our understanding of the migratory process, to understand new forms of mobility and incorporation, particularly the emergence of transnational communities, multiple identities and multi-layered citizenship.",,"community development; globalization; international migration; migration determinant; mobility; Asia; Europe",,,,,,,,,,,,"Castles, S.; University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom",,"Center for Migration Studies",01979183,,,,"English","Int.

The communication and co-operation between these system components is increasingly.crossing organisational, regional and even national borders using open networks including the Internet. Such interoperability must be provided in a secure way. Therefore, the different programmes launched by the European Commission dealing with informatics, telematics and the challenges of the Information Society also concern security-related projects. Value-adding the results of several projects within both the TAP and the ISIS programme of the EC as ISHTAR or TRUSTHEALTH on the one hand and MEDSEC or EUROMED-ETS on the other, a regional pilot in oncology for a secure health network has been developed and implemented. Specifying domains and their security policy, security requirements and solutions depending on the systems architecture and behaviour have been defined. Additionally to firewalls at the domain borders, security services based on cryptographic algorithms must be provided which concern application security and/or communication security according to the general security model specified, also taking into account that most of the attacks to domains are caused by insiders. Domains, policies and policy bridging are discussed under the view of security concepts and the concepts-services-mechanisms-algorithms-data relationships developed. Looking for the specific requirements of secure communications in open networks, communication security services and mechanisms will be presented. In that context, an open communication security solution regarding secure messaging (secure EDI) as well as secure channels (SSL and TLS in WWW environments) has been developed and implemented and will be demonstrated in detail.

Rather than IT rendering the body irrelevant to identity -a mistaken idea to begin with -the coupling of biometrics with IT unequivocally puts the body center stage. The questions to be raised about biometrics is how bodies will become related to identity, and what the normative and political ramifications of this coupling will be. Unlike the body rendered knowable in the biomedical sciences, biometrics generates a readable body: it transforms the body's surfaces and characteristics into digital codes and ciphers to be 'read' by a machine. ""Your iris is read, in the same way that your voice can be printed, and your fingerprint can be read"", by computers that, in turn, have become ""touch-sensitive"", and endowed with seeing and hearing capacities.

These metaphors open up ways to investigate the different meanings that will become attached to the biometric body and the ways in which it will be tied to identity.

Since it came into service in March 1995, the system has proved to be highly reliable technically, and on a daily basis it makes it possible to carry out arrests pending extradition, or to discover stolen vehicles throughout the Schengen area. The operation of such a system can only be conceivable within a framework for the respect of individual freedom. It is for this reason that the agreement lays down strict criteria regarding personal data protection, as well as an inspection procedure operated at two different levels by the national inspection authorities (the CNIL for France) and a common independent inspection authority, set up by the Schengen Member States.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00352616,,,,"French","Rev.

While the promotion of high technology sectors has become a major priority of European policy in recent years, the growing physical presence of subsidiaries of foreign multinational companies (MNCs) in the European Union (EU) has complicated the issue of what the promotion of ‘European high technology industry’ means. In practice, a large number of ‘foreign’ subsidiaries from EFTA and the US gain access to important European technology programmes such as ESPRIT, RACE, BRITE and EUREKA, as well as some national programmes. However, this has not been true for most subsidiaries of Japanese firms, despite the increasingly large presence they have in the European economy. This article asks what can explain this outcome. Two important cases which have brought issues of foreign firm access to the fore of European technology policy‐making, IBM and ICL‐Fujitsu, are examined. Both European corporate and state preferences need to be understood in order to explain outcomes in these cases. The argument is that a ‘technological Fortress Europe’ has not been a real policy option because European national champions have been unable to agree, and because certain governments, such as the UK, have perceived an interest in promoting foreign MNCs. European governments and institutions have moved towards a policy based more upon the location of economic activity rather than the ownership of assets. The article also suggests that theorists seeking to understand the consequences of globalization must consider not only how foreign investment, local production and alliances with local partners affect host state and corporate preferences, but also why broader cultural and historical factors also affect outcomes. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Corporate identity; European integration; Globalization; R & D; Semiconductors; Technology policy",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wyatt-Walter, A.; St Antony’s College, Oxford, United Kingdom",,,13501763,,,,"English","J.

But the existence of databases ranging from the relatively unsophisticated Schengen Information System and the proposed European Information System to the UCLAF system to combat fraud raises many legal and criminological issues. There is a danger that the database and profiling approach exaggerates the scale of organised crime to excuse unwarranted interference with civil liberties, and it is not easy to keep large databases secure from hackers. There is no proper mechanism for complaining about abuses, and there may be inadequate protection for political dissidents. On the other hand pooling of information enables the authorities to allocate scarce resources to the most harmful crimes and can help to minimise unwarranted invasions of privacy. National SIRENE bureaux provide judicial and administrative checks by filtering individual requests for information from databases, and safeguards have been built into the procedures for accessing the IRENE-3 database.

The Single European Act, the Schengen agreement, the Treaty of Maastricht, and the creation of the European Economic Area, have led to moves towards migration policy harmonisation in the West. New migration pressures, related to political events in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, the rise in asylum applications, and emigration from the poorer countries of the South, have given the harmonisation process added impetus. These trends have made it desirable to establish an information system to inform policy makers on current international migration trends. The system, presented here, allows evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of existing information sources, enables contemporary patterns and trends in European international migration, together with the processes creating them, to be discerned, and serves as a basis for identifying pertinent new research issues. Successive sections deal with: the information system (source inventories, tables, bibliography) and contemproary trends (typology, demography and economic background, stocks amd flows, migration in the Mediterranean region and in E.

A large number of schemes has been established, mainly in the U.S.A., but also in Western Europe. For the majority of these projects the aim has been to maximise gas recovery at already completed sites, or sections of sites. Gas recovery plant design has been almost purely ""retro-fit"" in concept. This approach can be costly both in terms of capital-overspend as well as possible ineffectiveness of gas leakage (or migration) control. Moreover, the ""Western"" methodology is generally inappropriate to landfills in Eastern European countries owing to the differing characteristics of landfill design such as surface cover placement, division of the site into cells, leachate and surface water collection. However, by considering carefully the special characteristics of these sites and, most significantly, adopting an ""integrated design"" approach, then energy recovery from landfill gas can be both profitable and environmentally beneficial. The aim of this paper is to identify the key factors which influence landfill gas collection effectiveness and to incorporate these in an overall site design strategy. In this way, the gas collection plant is optimised and linked directly to a specification for the site final cover contour. Simple design procedures are employed and the modelling and analysis aspects are short, concise and readily verifiable. This new methodology is discussed in detail and the design techniques are applied to a ""national"" Eastern European site. © 1990.",,"Gas Migration Control; Landfill Gas Control; Landfill Gas Mitigation Generation; Leachate; Municipal Solid Wastes; Biogas--Production; Energy Resources--Recovery; Gases--Recovery; Land Fill; biogas; conference paper; domestic waste; energy resource; landfill; solid waste management",,,,,,,,,,,,"Manley, B.J.W.; Environmental Resources Limited, 106 Gloucester Place, London, W1H 3DB, United Kingdom",,,09213449,,RCREE,,"English","Resour.
