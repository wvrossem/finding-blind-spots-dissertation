Based on findings from field research conducted in Greece, it aims to discuss how migrants' digital practices generate new spaces and materialities. Attending to the making of migrants’-ICTs intertwining it examines the emergence of unbordering practices, the creation of crucial solidarity networks and the risks and limitations that emerge when using ICTs. Finally, the paper highlights the recent migratory influx not simply as a result of neoliberal doctrines, but (also) as an act of disobedience to fortress Europe through the creation of digital-urban heterotopias through the lenses of Migration Studies, Science and Technology Studies and Critical spatial theory. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Heterotopia; ICTs; Migration; Multiple; Space","digital image; immigrant; information and communication technology; innovation; population migration; technological development; Greece",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122968511

Drawing on both International Relations and criminology, it develops an analytical framework to identify the political rationalities and technologies of crime control that the EU attempts to transfer across the Eastern and Southern (extended) neighbourhoods. By scrutinising 216 projects aimed at combating transnational crime beyond Europe's borders, spanning law enforcement, border security, criminal justice, and the penitentiary sector, the empirical analysis is geared towards detecting and systematising the ways of thinking and doing crime control that the EU seeks to promote and export. Moreover, it investigates the 'action at a distance' whereby it does so. It is argued that in shaping third countries' ability to criminalise, police, indict, convict, and punish, the EU is simultaneously defining its own security actorness, specifically consolidating its role as a 'global crime fighter'.

However, although the continuously increasing number of visitors, entering the EU through land-border crossing points or seaports, brings immense economic value, novel border control solutions, such as mobile devices for passenger identification for land/sea border control, are essential to precisely identify passengers &#x201C;on the fly&#x201D; ensuring their comfort. Nevertheless, these devices are expected to handle highly confidential personal data and thus, it is very likely to become an attractive target to malicious actors. Therefore, to ensure high level of device security without interrupting border control activities, strong secure and usable user authentication mechanisms are required. Towards this direction, we, firstly, discuss risk-based and adaptive authentication for mobile devices as a suitable approach to deal with the security vs. usability challenge and a novel risk-based adaptive user authentication mechanism is proposed to address this challenge. Afterwards, a set of popular Machine Learning (ML) classification algorithms for risk-based authentication was tested and evaluated on the HuMIdb (Human Mobile Interaction database) dataset to identify the most appropriate ones for the proposed mechanism. The evaluation results demonstrated impact of overfitting (i.e., accuracy: 1,0000) and therefore, we considered novelty detection algorithms to overcome this challenge and demonstrate high performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that novelty detection algorithms have been considered for risk-based adaptive user authentication showing promising results (OneClassSVM 0,9536, LOF 0,9740, KNN&#x005F;average 0,9998).

Drawing on the concept of border performativity, this article discusses how data is transforming the border. In particular, the article focuses on 1) how the EU JHA databases are evolving, from separate systems each with one purpose to multi-purpose databases, and 2) how the new EU plan – the interoperability regulation – connects and merges biometric and biographical data, as part of a shift from a silo-based approach towards a single centralised information system. The article - based on results of several research projects carried out between 2011 and 2019 adopting mixed methodology - discusses the border crossers’ role in challenging this digital border control, both in light of the current practices of data collection and processing and newly approved EU regulations. The article argues that the transformation of border control practices into practices driven by data processing makes it more difficult for border crossers to manoeuvre the system and legally challenge decisions based on data processing, thus, hampering the transformation of the border from below. © The Author(s) 2022.","borders; crimmigration; databases; European union; technology",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126299528

It argues that recent migration flows augmented pre-existing dynamics of growing reliance upon technology in EU border management. These dynamics are assessed through a study of the way emerging technologies, in particular Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV, commonly known as drones), and specific information and surveillance technologies installed on them, have become increasingly understood as crucial for the management of migration into the EU. The article synthesises securitisation theory with Science and Technology Studies to show, first, how the values reflected in border technologies often encapsulate a securitised understanding of the migrant, and second, how the migrants arriving in Europe have been characterised as both potential security threats and as individuals in need of rescue and protection. These frames trigger securitisation dynamics that portray the migration issue as amenable to state-of-the-art technology. In this logic, security ‘problems’ and security ‘solutions’ are co-produced within a complex multi-layered network of public and private actors. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","border management; drones; European Union; expertise; securitisation; Technology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097812318

Funded under the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 programme, the system is analysed in relation to the wider political economy of ‘emotional AI’ and the history of deception detection technologies. We then move on to interrogate the design of iBorderCtrl using publicly available documents and assess the assumptions and scientific validation underpinning the project design. Finally, drawing on a Bayesian analysis we outline statistical fallacies in the foundational premise of mass screening and argue that it is very unlikely that the model that iBorderCtrl provides for deception detection would work in practice. By interrogating actual systems in this way, we argue that we can begin to question the very premise of the development of data-driven systems, and emotional AI and deception detection in particular, pushing back on the assumption that these systems are fulfilling the tasks they claim to be attending to and instead ask what function such projects carry out in the creation of subjects and management of populations.

In this introduction biometric identification (or IDentification) is presented as a relatively new area of investigation that has been subjected to little ethnographic scrutiny. It is argued that, while biometric technologies are promoted as enabling objective and incontestable IDentification of individuals, they are in practice embedded in specific social contexts, fraught with ambiguity and uncertainty, and dependent on substantial human interpretation and social identification.

To conceptualize the maintenance labour through which information systems are governed, I synthesize ideas developed in Michel Foucault’s work on biopolitics and governmentality with contributions that explore the agentic forces and proclivities of technoscientific matter. By unearthing the very mechanics of maintenance processes, I make two contributions to the literature that interrogates the digitization and smartening of border security. First, I demonstrate that attending to maintenance permits a more complete understanding of the agency of information systems. Second, I broaden the research agenda that explores border security as practice by directing attention towards the often invisible, but politically significant, labour of maintainers who, by rendering information systems functional, sustain the power to govern international mobility by digital means. © The Author(s) 2020.","Border security; information systems; maintenance; Michel Foucault; New Materialisms",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094209777

One of its central aims was, by predicting challenges related to increased migration, to improve resource allocation and prevent crime. By drawing on research on risk and threat assessment as a form of power, this article aims to analyze how risk categories are distributed and translated into a multilayered institutional arrangement where migration is policed as a potential crime. The article examines the indicators that the risk assessments are based on, and the measures applied and investigates how discretionary practices make immigrants objects for law enforcement and policing. The article contributes to research on migration control in an ordinary police context, where immigration identity checks become part of the crime reduction strategy. Applying the concept of interpretive flexibility (Collins 1981), I will identify the steps in this chain of translation to explore the leap from targeting potentially criminal asylum seekers to targeting broader groups with temporary residency in Norway. The article analyzes the conditions determining how policing, technologies, and migrants are ""co-constructed"" in a chain of mediation and translation, which reinforces the view of migrants as risky and criminal. The final section discusses how risk and threat analysis is affected by the notion of the ""crimmigrant other"" (Franko 2020).

This method of data visualisation unearths the deep patterns of opposition that run across the sociotechnical universe where European borders are designed and created. We identify three rationalities of power at play: territorial surveillance aimed at detecting rare events in remote areas, policing of dense human flows by sorting out the benign from the dangerous, and finally global dataveillance of cargo on the move. Instead of trends towards either the hardening of borders or their virtualisation, we, therefore, find multiple rationalities of power simultaneously redefining the modalities of control at EU borders. A second finding shows where precisely critical actors are located in this sociotechnical universe and indicates that the structure of European R&D in border security keeps irregularised migrants off their radars.

It presents empirical ethnographic evidence, gathered between January and June 2017, from Skaramagas and Elaionas camps in Athens. Although intended as temporary humanitarian solutions, many migrants have remained in them for long periods, stuck in a state of temporariness. Camps have been studied extensively through the lens of biopolitics as spaces of abandonment and abjectification. More recently, a growing body of literature is highlighting the everyday micro-politics and tactics of belonging that take place within them. Drawing on the latter, I shed light on the temporal aspects of border control involved in camps, arguing that camps provide a temporal, rather than only spatial, technology that governs encamped migrants through the administration of their time. Thus, the camp governs the critical moment between reception and in/exclusion from the polity. Yet, as I show, within this condition of semi-permanence and semi-presence, camp residents, through the practice of everyday life, being present and visible, create places and give new meanings to existing ones.

Information in its different forms, whether paper-based or digital, has always been fundamental to decision-making conduct. Concretely, the premise holds that decisions shall be based on correct, full, and adequate knowledge and reasoning. Technological innovation has, however, magnified information capacities and significance. The article in that respect maintains that the 'decisional value' of automatically-processed information consequently also alters the nature of the respective decision-making - from a conventional type where the agent exercises discretion to a 'semi-automated' conduct in which automation inhibits the agent's decision-making capacity.

In the European Union (EU), this trend has been shown by the frequent overlap between asylum application and migration policies and the agenda concerning border control, security, and terrorism. This securitization of migration discourse is claimed to justify the use of controversial practices to examine asylum applications. Against this background, the article reflects on the use of technology-assisted and automated decisions in this area. In particular, it questions whether the existing safeguards provided in the EU data protection framework ensure asylum seekers' rights to privacy and the protection of personal data. In doing so, the article seeks to offer a more nuanced understanding of European asylum policy and the potential flaws therein that allow individuals' fundamental rights-enshrined in the EU Charter and the European Convention on Human Rights-to be infringed.

A field in which this has become particularly salient is digitized EU border management. Here, the framework of responsible research and innovation (RRI) has recently been used to point to the alleged sensitivity of political actors towards the contingent dimensions of emerging security technologies. RRI, in general, is concerned with societal needs and the engagement and inclusion of various stakeholder groups in the research and innovation processes, aiming to anticipate undesired consequences of and identifying socially acceptable alternatives for emerging technologies. However, RRI has also been criticized as an industry-driven attempt to gain societal legitimacy for new technologies. In this article, we argue that while RRI evokes a space where different actors enter co-creative dialogues, it lays bare the specific challenges of governing security innovation in socially responsible ways. Empirically, we draw on the case study of BODEGA, the first EU funded research project to apply the RRI framework to the field of border security. We show how stakeholders involved in the project represent their work in relation to RRI and the resulting benefits and challenges they face. The paper argues that applying the framework to the field of (border) security lays bare its limitations, namely that RRI itself embodies a political agenda, conceals alternative experiences by those on whom security is enacted upon and that its key propositions of openness and transparency are hardly met in practice due to confidentiality agreements. Our hope is to contribute to work on RRI and emerging debates about how the concept can (or cannot) be contextualized for the field of security—a field that might be more in need than any other to consider the ethical dimension of its activities. © 2021, The Author(s).","Innovation; Responsible research and innovation (RRI); Science and technology studies (STS); Security; Smart borders","human; research ethics; Ethics, Research; Humans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101192479

The author follows the construction of the FTF as a serious security threat to the European Union’s strategies and action plans, and demonstrates the EU’s practical actions to respond the threat: criminalization of “suspicious travel”, strengthening border security, preliminary screening of asylum seekers at the border. The article pays special attention to the EU plans to achieve compatibility of the European Union information systems, while emphasizing new opportunities for the law enforcement bodies to access migration databases for combating terrorism. Exploring the new EU integration plan for migrants, the author notes that this is for the first time that the European Commission focuses its efforts not only on migrants, but also on the EU citizens with “migratory background”, which is undoubtedly dictated by a fear of the extremist ideology influence on young people. The article exposes certain similarities between the Commission’s methods to coordinate integration and inclusion of migrants, reintegration of the FTF and their families, which indicates that the migration policy is becoming a part of the EU security policy. That leads to a conclusion that securitization of migration policy aims not only and not so much at preventing the potential threat of the returnees’ terrorist activities, but at curbing migration flows as a whole and reducing the number of asylum seekers, in particular. Nevertheless, terrorism and migration seem to be closely linked in public discourse, despite the absence of an empirical basis to conclude that these factors directly influence each other. The author considers the most difficult problem of modern migration policy to be the definition of the red line beyond which its securitization can be justified. © 2021 Olga Yu.

Critical sectors such as transport are progressively depending on digital technologies to run their core operations and develop novel solutions to exploit the economic strengths of the European Union. However, despite the fact that the continuously increasing number of visitors, entering the European Union through land-border crossing points or seaports, brings tremendous economic benefits, novel border control solutions, such as mobile devices for passenger identification for land and sea border control, are essential to accurately identify passengers 'on the fly' while ensuring their comfort. However, the highly confidential personal data managed by these devices makes them an attractive target for cyberattacks. Therefore, novel secure and usable user authentication mechanisms are required to increase the level of security of this kind of devices without interrupting border control activities. Towards this direction, we, firstly, discuss risk-based and adaptive authentication for mobile devices as a suitable approach to deal with the security vs. usability challenge.

It argues that PNR data processing should at the same time be understood as part of the alternatives to border checks available for Member States to regulate cross-border mobility in the Schengen area and as a standout among these measures. PNR data processing challenges the existing legal framework of Article 23(a) of the Schengen Borders Code (SBC) as well as the assessment framework developed by the CJEU in its relevant case-law, not because it contravenes Schengen rules, but because it stretches and overflows them. Ultimately, PNR data processing puts into question the very understanding of what checks performed in relation to the act or intention of crossing a border actually stand for or whether controls related to border crossings can be characterised as border controls. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2021","Free movement; Internal borders; PNR; Schengen; Systematic checks",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122806374

In our research, we had all identified suspicion as characteristic of migration governance. We saw it in the anxiety-ridden public discourses surrounding ‘unwanted’ immigration, in increasingly repressive legal frameworks, in bureaucratic classification schemes and technologies designed to identify suspected, illegalised travellers or deserving from undeserving asylum applicants, and finally, in the distrustful gaze of street-level bureaucrats enforcing migration law. We had also experienced suspicion directed against us as researchers by the state agencies we were studying. Based on these observations, this introduction develops a conceptual framework of states of suspicion, which captures how suspicion permeates migration control on the individual as well as structural level: as an affective element, as codified in law and institutionalised practice, and as manifested in material border and migration control technologies. The contributions to the special section shed light on these various elements, and taken together, enabling us to capture the constitutive nature of suspicion in contemporary migration control regimes. The special section discusses the implications of suspicion, in particular for those people who are rendered suspicious by default.

States provide migrants’ biometric data to transnational databases that are increasingly interoperable in the area of migration and crime control, to be accessible for state-based law enforcement actors.

Recently there has been a considerable increase in the use of computational techniques to predict migration flows, and advances have allowed for application of improved algorithms in the field. However, given the rapid pace of technological development facilitating these new predictive tools and methods for migration, it is important to address the extent to which such instruments and techniques engage with and impact migration governance. This study provides an in‐depth examination of selected existing predictive tools in the migration field and their impact on the governance of migratory flows. It focuses on a comparative qualitative examination of these tools’ scope, as well as how these characteristics link to their respective underlying migration theory, research question, or objective. It overviews how several organisations have developed tools to predict short‐ or longer‐term migration patterns, or to assess and estimate migration uncertain-ties. At the same time, it demonstrates how and why these instruments continue to face limitations that in turn affect migration management, especially as it relates to increasing EU institutional and stakeholder efforts to forecast or predict mixed migration. The main predictive migration tools in use today cover different scopes and uses, and as such are equally valid in shaping the requirements for a future, fully comprehensive predictive migration tool. This article provides clarity on the requirements and features for such a tool and draws conclusions as to the risks and opportunities any such tool could present for the future of EU migration governance. © 2021 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","European union; Forecasting; Migration governance; Predictive tools",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118163272

The discussion draws on episodes of participant observation with Bulgarian arrivals to trace the tightening of administrative procedures that ensued in the aftermath of labour market liberalisation in 2014. These are explored for their productive, rather than restrictive potential, namely, for implicating migrants in a bureaucratically induced temporality of ‘protracted arrival’ in the process of which they are stripped off of their formal rights and made dependent on subordinated forms of employment and existence within the confines of the ‘migrant economy’. By exploring the politics and experiences of intra-EU migration through analytical concepts devised for ‘precarious’ movements, such as ‘bordering’, ‘differential inclusion’, and ‘permanent temporariness’, this article questions the incisive conceptual and empirical binaries between internal and external migrations and joins the voices of those warning to the eroding protection of EU citizenship. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bordering; Bulgarian; informal economy; Intra-EU migration; temporality",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106283408

It introduces the concept of borderwork ‘creep’, to highlight how border management practices have, in the last 15 years, expanded along three axes. This term borrows from debates on ‘function creep’ in surveillance studies which have generally been focused on digital technologies in the global north. The first axis is a cartographic one, with borderwork functioning through a denial of cartographic limits to border security. Borderwork has crept inland, with security practices taking an expansive vision of the borderland and bringing controls to key inland nodes. The second is that of a cross-pollination of policy areas with a growing role for judicialised modes of justification for borderwork. The third relates to faith in technology, with new digital geographies making borderwork in the Sahel reliant on data handling and sharing. To make these arguments, the article draws on fieldwork since 2013 in Senegal, Mauritania, and Niger. By examining the breadth and expansion of borderwork in the Sahel, it contests visions that centre ‘Fortress Europe’ and instead highlights the multiple often overlapping global and local interests that expand borderwork in the Sahel. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105929982

While much discussion of border struggles focuses on migrants’ resistance and various forms of activism, this paper provides insights on the micro-resistance of those who, instead of overtly opposing and contesting the biopolitical power of border regimes, are integral to their operation: asylum caseworkers who filter and select border-crossers. The paper presents data from interviews with self-identified leftist asylum caseworkers in Greece who, through their work, seek to create cracks in the so-called ‘Fortress Europe’. By exploring the somewhat unexplored occupational culture of leftist asylum caseworkers, we show how, while trying to resist bordering regimes, leftist asylum caseworkers both critique and reproduce the power relations they seek to subvert. Essentially, we provide valuable insights on the limits of resistance due to the workings of powerful technologies of government–informed by neoliberal managerialism–that are operational in day-to-day life of the asylum process.

Illustrated through an encounter between a migrant and the Visa Information System (VIS)–one of the largest migration-related biometric databases worldwide–the article’s first part outlines three implications of digitisation. We argue that the VIS assembles a set of previously unconnected state authorities into a group of end users who enact border security and migration management through the gathering, processing and sharing of data; facilitates the practice of traceability, understood as a rationality of mobility control; and has restrictive effects on migrants’ capacity to manoeuvre and resist control. Given these implications, the article’s second part introduces three analytical sensitivities that help to avoid some analytical traps when studying digitisation processes. These sensitivities take their cue from insights and concepts in science and technology studies (STS), specifically material semiotics/ANT approaches. They concern, firstly, the ways that data-based security practices perform the identities of the individuals that they target; secondly, the need to consider possible practices of subversion by migrants to avoid control-biased analyses; and finally, the challenge to study the design and development of border security technologies without falling into either technological or socio-political determinism. © 2020 The Author(s).

Scholars have, however, tended to apprehend dispersal in its geographical dimension, failing to interrogate bordering beyond spatial distancing from the territorial edges of the state. Furthermore, dispersal strategies in non-European countries are underexplored. We start filling these gaps by examining how dispersal operates in Morocco–a country where, since the announcement of a new migration policy in 2013, the routine internal dispersal of groups of dark-skinned people racially profiled as ‘illegal sub-Saharan’ by Moroccan police forces has become commonplace. Drawing on extensive qualitative fieldwork conducted between 2016 and 2019, as well press articles and NGO reports, we advance a dynamic understanding of bordering by analysing how the repeated spatial relocation of migrant people works through and in tandem with mechanisms of dispossession. We draw together literature on dispersal as migration governance and on dispossession as containment, proposing that dispersal activates practices of dispossession that expand the reach of bordering beyond spatial distance, turning it into an embodied technology: migrant people profiled as ‘sub-Saharan’ experience bordering as a form of inflicted hypermobility and a condition of protracted, unbearable living to which they are confined. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bordering; dispersal; dispossession; immigration; Morocco","dispersal; governance approach; immigrant population; immigration; immigration policy; migration; mobility; Morocco",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088972435

While the policing of mobilities is increasingly discussed in terms of instantaneity, speed, and real-timeness, little has been said about the temporalities of data mobility. This paper focuses on the socio-technical architectures that are generative of data mobilities and analyses the temporality of data circulation as the outcome of a contingent formation of various actors, sites, and materials. Based on an indepth analysis of the Frontex information system Joint Operation Reporting Application (JORA), it works out several sources of turbulence that turn data mobility into a ‘crooked’ process of patching multiple temporalities and paces together. It will show how the implementation of JORA faces data frictions, issues of data quality, the synchronization of multiple orderings, and the clash of temporalities of border control practices on the ground. Thus, the infrastructuring of data circulation has effects on interorganizational forms of collaboration and knowledge production as well as on border work in the field of European migration and border control. © 2020 The Author(s).

The article argues that life in the CETI presents the fundamental characteristics of an existence inscribed within a total institution, implying the use of discipline as a technology of power and a structure of relations based on deference, in the specific guise of residents’ condition as ‘subjects to be integrated’. Furthermore, the article identifies three forms of dispossession–material, role and time-related–carried out against the background of a fictional integration, each bringing its share of gendered implications.

Alterity processing refers to the data infrastructures, knowledge practices, and bureaucratic procedures through which populations unknown to European actors are translated into “European-legible” identities. By drawing on fieldwork conducted in Italy and the Hellenic Republic from 2017 to 2018, this article argues that different registration and identification procedures compete to legitimize different chains of actors, data, and metadata as more authoritative than others. Competing procedures have governance implications, as well, with some actors being included and others being excluded. Furthermore, there is evidence that—despite procedural rigidities—applicants themselves propose alternative chains of actors, data, and metadata that are more meaningful to them. In this tension, it is not only the individual Other that is enacted but also specific bureaucratic orders cutting across old and new European actors and distinctive understandings of “Europe.” From a technology studies perspective, this article engages in a dialogue with the emergent debate on Hotspots, the scholarship about the infrastructural construction of Europe and political sociology. © The Author(s) 2019.","bureaucracy; data infrastructures; Europe; metadata; migration; population",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061591320

If the EU uses its law enforcement and border control tools to the full, exploits the potential of inter-operability between information sources to identify any security concerns from a common pool of information, and uses the stage of entry into the EU as a key point for security checks to take place, the result will negate the ability of terrorist networks to exploit gaps.

They are the most advanced form of information exchange, conferring direct information access to competent authorities. Interoperable information systems are intended for the exchange of raw material for investigation purposes, which at a later stage could become evidence at trial. Interoperable information systems challenge existing cooperation dynamics and redefine the role of the actors involved. It is questionable whether mutual recognition and approximation, which have been considered the cornerstone of judicial cooperation in both civil and criminal matters for many years, can describe alone integration dynamics in law enforcement cooperation, particularly with reference to information sharing. This article appraises whether, and to what extent, law enforcement access to and use of interoperable information systems constitute new modes of law enforcement cooperation in the EU AFSJ. It then assesses what would be the implications of such a paradigm shift on information management. After a short overview of the main features of interoperability, it addresses whether and how the establishment and functioning of interoperable information systems actually or potentially redefines the existing distribution of tasks between th EU and Member States and among competent authorities of different kinds. © 2020 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands","approximation; Area of Freedom Security and Justice; European Union; information management; interoperability; law enforcement; mutual recognition; platform integration; principle of availability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099545095

At the same time, the way in which the ongoing interoperability initiatives regarding the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ) databases may influence Europol’s international cooperation raises arguably a set of new legal and practical questions that require urgent consideration. This article examines these issues by connecting the Europol-specific legal framework and international practice to the recently adopted AFSJ interoperability regulations as well as to the EU broader data protection framework. It looks more specifically at the balance between data protection/fundamental rights and operational effectiveness throughout Europol’s legal framework and practice of international cooperation and examines the implications of interoperability of AFSJ databases on this. On the one hand, interoperability of AFSJ databases is likely to boost Europol as an information hub through extended personal data collection and data processing possibilities, thereby making the Agency more attractive to international partners. On the other hand, the possibility to transfer such data outside the EU requires strong and effective safeguards from a data protection perspective. The article tentatively concludes that Europol’s current legal and practical framework for international cooperation seems to tilt the balance on the side of operational effectiveness to the detriment of data protection and fundamental rights, and that the new possibilities offered by the interoperability of AFSJ databases will further enhance this trend. © 2020 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands","AFSJ databases; data protection; effective police cooperation; Europol; fundamental rights; international cooperation; interoperability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099531525

It sets out features of contemporary migration control practices and their legal governance that contribute to this phenomenon, namely the exceptional treatment of migration in international law; the limited scope of international refugee law; and the pervasive use of externalized, delegated migration controls, in particular by the EU and its Member States. The roots of the current condition are traced back to the containment practices that emerged at the end of the Cold War, with the 2015 ""crisis""framed both as an illustration of the failures of containment, and a source of further stasis. Following an overview of the contributions that make up the Special Issue, this Article identifies five emergent themes, and suggests further lines of inquiry. These are: the promise and limits of strategic human rights limitations; the role of both international criminal law, and domestic (and regional) tort law in securing accountability; the turn to positive obligations to challenge entrenched features of containment; and the role of direct action in support of and solidarity with those challenging migration controls most directly, refugees and migrants themselves. Rather than offering panaceas, the Article concludes with the identification of further new challenges, notably the role of new technologies in further dissipating lines of accountability for decisions to exclude. © The Author(s) 2020.","Human rights; International law; Litigation; Migration; Refugees",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096122487

The entry ban entails that a non-citizen expelled from one member state is barred from returning to the whole Schengen area for up to five years, or longer in case of a threat to public policy or national security. The pan-European validity of the entry ban is ensured by an alert entered in the Schengen Information System (SIS). The alert is a set of personal data registered in the SIS which states may process to identify the person with a view of the refusal of entry. Processing personal data of non-citizens may pose a challenge to the protection of their data.

Turkey’s south-eastern border with Syria has been continuously upgraded with walls and fences incorporating advanced security technology. The border with Greece has witnessed a similar bordering process particularly under pressure from the European Union. Drawing on critical border studies and adopting a Foucauldian lens, this article explores these bordering processes, taking security technology as a heterogonous ensemble of practices that consists of discourses, regulations, institutions, threat perceptions, scientific knowledge etc. Finally, the article comes to two important conclusions. First, it suggests that the detection, filtering and prevention of ‘illegal’ border crossings, smuggling and terrorism are the key reasons advanced for the adoption of technologically intensive border control practices. On the other hand, a more ‘humanitarian discourse’, namely ‘saving the lives of migrants’ is also at play. Second, these security technologies are now increasingly embodied in practices of ‘inclusion’/‘exclusion’ that distinguish ‘risky’ (i.e. illegitimate) from ‘safe’ (i.e. legitimate) mobilities and that create spaces where inequality and injustice are experienced. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","biopolitics; Bordering processes; critical border studies; technology; Turkey",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089967945

EU laws and Schengen regulations support states’ implementation of high-tech methods in migration governance and police work. Our fieldwork, conducted with several police units in France and Romania, indicates a gap between the claimed ‘controlled’ management of mobility through crimmigration and the actual messiness at the Schengen border as a result of policy implementation limitations (lack of legislative adjustment to digital demands), poor administration (training of border agents, allocating resources) and political decisions (harmonisation or competing narratives). Despite the promotion of cutting-edge technologies in the deportation process, traditional techniques as well as paperwork remain relevant. This raises questions regarding the articulations of traditional techniques with highly promoted control technologies. While the latter has modified the functioning of the deportation process, these changes do not necessarily make the former useless. In practice, this work is left to the discretion of police officers and ground-level bureaucrats who interpret, create and enforce norms and regulations in the name of ‘the rule of law’. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","borders; citizenship; Digital technologies; migration; Schengen",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089960261

In recent years, scholars in social sciences and humanities have shown the continuities of colonialism and racism in the politics of biometric identification. Not only are the origins of biometrics closely related to colonial governance and scientific racism, but contemporary biometric technologies also continue to carry on colonial and racial dimensions in their infrastructures and operations. Inspired by Quijano’s notion of ‘coloniality of power’ and departing from existing social and cultural studies of biometrics, the article explores how biometrics is used for the racial classification of people, the (re)production of colonial structures and subject-object relations during and after colonialism. The article focuses on the case of fingerprinting border controls and surveillance in post-imperial Japan. This particular case geographically expands the literature on the relationship between biometrics and colonialism, which has been largely centred upon European and North American contexts. It also helps to understand how one mode of racialization through biometrics is replaced by another, which empowers a new form of racial governance. Drawing on my analysis of the postwar Japanese fingerprinting system, I suggest that it is important to register different forms of racialization through biometrics as there are different forms of racialized control in different historical and geographical contexts. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Biometrics; borders; colonialism; coloniality; Japan; racialization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087828965

In this buffer zone, the EU and its member states impose on refugees and migrants a survival test that stops all but the fittest from entering–a test that often results in serious and irreversible human rights violations.

From Big Data predictions about population movements in the Mediterranean, to Canada’s use of automated decision-making in immigration and refugee applications, to artificialintelligence lie detectors deployed at European borders, States are keen to explore the use of new technologies, yet often fail to take into account profound human rights ramifications and real impacts on human lives. These technologies are largely unregulated, developed and deployed in opaque spaces with little oversight and accountability. This paper examines how technologies used in the management of migration impinge on human rights with little international regulation, arguing that this lack of regulation is deliberate, as States single out the migrant population as a viable testing ground for new technologies. Making migrants more trackable and intelligible justifies the use of more technology and data collection under the guise of national security, or even under tropes of humanitarianism and development. The way that technology operates is a useful lens that highlights State practices, democracy, notions of power, and accountability. Technology is not inherently democratic and human rights impacts are particularly important to consider in humanitarian and forced migration contexts. An international human rights law framework is particularly useful for codifying and recognising potential harms, because technology and its development is inherently global and transnational. More oversight and issue-specific accountability mechanisms are needed to safeguard fundamental rights of migrants such as freedom from discrimination, privacy rights and procedural justice safeguards such as the right to a fair decision-maker and the rights of appeal. © 2019 The Author.","Artificial intelligence; Global governance; International human rights law; Migration; Migration management; New technologies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084223021

In contrast to the indifference or outright hostility with which migrants and refugees have often been treated, a well-intentioned but Eurocentric trope, evident in Ode to Lesvos, is the attempt made by ‘ordinary’ citizens to offer hospitality to those arriving at the continent’s borders. On the other hand, Les Sauteurs (Those Who Jump) presents migrants’ own actions as in part a form of political resistance. Finally, I consider how Gianfranco Rosi’s Fuocoammare (Fire at Sea) and Thomas Østbye’s Imagining Emanuel interrogate the scrutiny, discipline and control endured by asylum seekers and migrants, processes that form part of the unmarked and unremarked upon Žižekian ‘objective violence’ that sustains the European system.

In this article, we critically evaluate that claim by developing a notion of deliberation along Habermasian lines, in which deliberation is understood as a process that induces negotiating partners to change positions through argumentation. Based on this conceptualization, we explore to what extent and under which conditions deliberation is likely to occur in intergovernmental settings. To that end, we analyse decision-making on the proposal to give law enforcement authorities access to the Visa Information System.

Our case study is situated in Romania. Whereas “the Roma” do not exist as a category in the Romanian national registry of citizens, mainstream public discourses regarding “Roma migration” have significantly proliferated over the past decades. Yet, how do authorities come to know “the Roma” and how do they render groups of citizens into racialized populations? We examine two bureaucratic practices in Romania, the census and the registry of citizens, and show how the latter is enacted through various “technologies of vision.” We focus on the category of “the Roma” as a material semiotic configuration enacted by various “data” regarding issues such as territorial segregation, phenotypic appearance, smell, and dialect. Situated at the intersection of Border and Surveillance Studies, Romani Studies, and Science and Technologies Studies, this paper contributes to debates about how “the Roma” are rendered visible in practices of identification and migration management in Europe. © The Author(s) 2019.","border management; Europe; mobility; Racialization; Roma; technologies of vision","border region; bureaucracy; ethnic minority; ethnicity; mobility; policy approach; population migration; racial identity; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070252401

The bordering practices of the European nation states have now both been dispersed into third countries and come to include frontline bureaucrats within the nation states, including social workers and healthcare staff. Without much public debate, healthcare and social welfare policies have become part of migration management policies. In the following, I explore new ways of understanding the relationship between borders, healthcare and the management of migrants in the welfare state of Norway. The article draws on fieldwork with migrants who have been irregularised after their asylum applications were rejected. I introduce the concept of ‘intimate borders’ to call attention to how irregular migrants are managed in the encounters between migrants and frontline bureaucrats such as healthcare workers. In these encounters, the legal status of the person becomes an ordering mode, and the potential disease to be treated becomes a subordinate object of concern.

A vast infrastructure supports its visualization, making migration visible and actionable. Recent scholarship on the visuality of migration has clearly shown how visualizing migration is an integral part of governing it. Concepts and research approaches from Science and Technology Studies (STS) are particularly appropriate when studying these connections between knowing and doing. In this paper, the performativity of visual methods and their data practices are analysed with respect to the monitoring infrastructure of European border management. Three such methods – patrolling, recording and publicizing – are reconstructed through analysis of their histories and their present. Patrolling involves the tactical domination of terrains. Recording involves the production of documentary objectivity. Publicizing involves the pictorial capture of fleeting realities. These methods are irreducibly political. Their political significance is explored through the concept of demonstrative effects that helps to show how methods of visualising migration at once involve specific demonstrations of the European association that is operative in them. These demonstrations make visible what Europe can and cannot do. The so-called ‘migration crisis’ of Europe turns out to be more than political discourse but entangled with the very methods that render migration apparent and governable. © The Author(s) 2018.","borders; demonstration; Europe; Migration monitoring; performativity; visuality","border region; conceptual framework; migration; monitoring; political discourse; popular protest; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052579935

Various legislative proposals have reflected a range of congressional perspectives and priorities, including with regard to • the authorization of the activities of the U.S. Armed Forces related to the conflict; • the extent of U.S. logistical, material, advisory, and intelligence support for the coalition led by Saudi Arabia; • the approval, disapproval, or conditioning of U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia; • the appropriation of funds for U.S. operations in support of the Saudi-led coalition; • the conduct of the Saudi-led coalition's air campaign and its adherence to international humanitarian law and the laws of armed conflict; • the demand for greater humanitarian access to Yemen; • the call for a wider government assessment of U.S. policy toward Yemen and U.S. support to parties to the conflict; • the nature and extent of U.S.-Saudi counterterrorism and border security cooperation; and • the role of Iran in supplying missile technology and other weapons to the forces of the Houthi movement. The 116th Congress may continue to debate U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition and Saudi Arabia's conduct of the war in Yemen, where fighting has continued since March 2015. The war has exacerbated a humanitarian crisis in Yemen that began in 2011; presently, the World Food Program reports that 20 million Yemenis face hunger in the absence of sustained food assistance. The difficulty of accessing certain areas of Yemen has made it hard for governments and aid agencies to count the war's casualties. Data collected by the U.S. and European-funded Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project (ACLED) suggest that 60,000 Yemenis have been killed since January 2016. The Trump Administration has opposed various congressional proposals, including initiatives to reject or condition proposed U.S. arms sales or to require an end to U.S. military support to Saudi-led coalition operations in Yemen. Many in Congress have condemned the October 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi government personnel, and in general, the incident appears to have exacerbated existing congressional concerns about Saudi leaders and the pace, scope, and direction of change in the kingdom's policies.

Second, the article analyzes four examples of everyday coordination mechanisms: new technologies (like Facebook groups and Whatsapp chats), peer-to-peer refugee coordination, maps of services, and field-level working groups. Everyday coordination threatened state authority because it governed actors in a different way, created parallel systems, and sometimes promoted competing goals.

The present investigation deals with the comparative studies of UAVs used for Libyan border's protection between ELI-XL multi-raptor UAVs, Desert Hawk III (DH III) UAVs, RQ-IIB Raven UAVs, Silent Falcon UAVs and Phantom 4 Advanced. © 2019 IEEE.","Border Protection; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","Aerial photography; Antennas; Landforms; Laws and legislation; Military photography; Military vehicles; Radio transmission; Remote sensing; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Border protection; Comparative studies; Geographical positions; Illegal immigrants; Search and rescue; Security stabilities; Tracking and forecasting; Traffic monitoring; Aircraft detection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065498752

Cultural Studies have been crucial in revealing how everyday, particularly media-oriented practices, make and unmake this ‘Fortress’. Yet, until now, the focus has been mostly on how migrants use or are represented through media discourses and technologies. This introduction essay argues that the signifier ‘Fortress Europe’—and its central premise of restraining mobility for some in order to enable freedom for others—also gains meaning in and through socio-cultural practices that we may not (as) immediately associate with the physical crossing of European borders. Particular practices that are discussed in this introduction and examined in the seven original articles of the special issue are: public opinion research, the public mobilization of emotions, negotiating identity in an ‘ancestral homeland’, the consumption of (sports) media, the production of a radio talk show and film archives, as well as the activist use of social media. Broadening scholarly attention to these kinds of sociocultural practices provides an important addition to understanding how power operates across social spheres and discursive orders. In addition, their identification also offers valuable opportunities to understand how and why some practices are particularly pertinent or effective in cementing or destabilizing Fortress Europe. This line of inquiry is visible throughout this special issue, despite the diversity of theoretical frameworks and empirical sites used in the contributing articles. © The Author(s) 2019.","borders; Cultural studies; discourse; Europe; liberal paradox; racism; social exclusion; socio-cultural practices",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061747511

The authors reveal the issues of using the Internet as a tool of the loyal border management of the united countries, ensuring the liberalization of the movement of factors of production through the creation of a single space of freedom, security and justice. The infocommunication technologies are researched as a management mechanism with regard to their influence on modern geopolitical, economic, and specifically industrial processes. The indicated approach is implemented simultaneously both as the management of the content of political relations and the management of their form. The Schengen border management information system is regarded as one of the most striking examples of the information technologies use in the political, economic, and specifically industrial sphere. The structure and legal mechanisms of this system operation are analyzed, on the basis of which the advantages and disadvantages of technological and legal nature are revealed. Special attention is paid to the analysis of the draft laws under development aimed at the improvement of the Schengen information system as an electronic technology for the automated border management of the pan-European space of freedom, security and justice. Among other things the authors have taken into account the latest changes in the legal regulation of the Schengen information system, which took place in October 2018.Taking into account the identified shortcomings in the functioning of the Schengen information system, the recommendations for their elimination are formulated. It is concluded that it is necessary to create a single European information portal in order to optimize the processing of data received from the different agencies. The general trends of the SIS II reform are the simplification and acceleration of the procedures, as well as the strengthening of the personal data protection. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Industrial economics; Information use; Security of data; Business management; Electronic technologies; Factors of production; Industrial processs; Information and Communication Technologies; Information portals; Management mechanisms; Security and justices; Information management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063966861

The recent emergencies related to immigration revealed the substantial inefficiency of conventional means of border patrolling based on warships, coast guard speedboats and helicopters. A reliable technical answer to these emergency problems may come from the use of different kinds of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These flying vehicles may allow at improving border control. Nevertheless, such technologies require significant amount of personnel, energy and infrastructure to properly serve border protection. In order to be really effective, UAVs should autonomously cooperate in networked manner, collecting information from the on-ground and/or water-surface sensors, exchanging data among them and conveying the critical information to remote border control centres. This is the main objective of DAVOSS project (Dynamic Architectures based on UAVs Monitoring for border Security and Safety), funded by NATO in the framework of the Science for Peace and Security Programme. This paper aims at presenting the novel adaptive and virtualized aerospace network architecture proposed in DAVOSS. The leading concepts of DAVOSS are flexibility, dynamic reconfigurability, energy efficiency and broadband connection availability also in critical application scenarios. In order to improve robustness and resilience of the avionic network and to enable the efficient information backhaul also in absence of terrestrial links, advanced networking and communications technologies like Software-Defined Networking (SDN), network slicing and virtualization are introduced. System requirements, coming from potential end-users, along with real application scenarios will be carefully analyzed in order to drive the architectural design phase, whose preliminary outcomes will be shown in the paper. Preliminary results demonstrate the effectiveness of the adoption of virtualization techniques for the considered aerospace network architecture in terms of reduced power consumption at the drone side, with an observed tradeoff with latency. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Antennas; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Flight control systems; Memory architecture; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Virtual reality; Virtualization; Warships; Broadband connection; Critical applications; Dynamic architecture; Dynamic reconfigurability; Networking and communication; Reduced power consumption; Software defined networking (SDN); Virtualization Techniques; Network architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068323028

Since its establishment, the Schengen Visa has been an extraordinary example of the success of a borderless region and led to vibrant in growth and social development. ASEAN, as a new economic community that tries to set itself as a beneficiary of the lessons learned from the European Union, has been struggling in establishing its own common visa region. The reasons encompass economic, political, and social-cultural concerns. This study focuses specifically on the Lao PDR and it aims to assess the preparedness of the country if the region were to establish the common visa system. The study employs a qualitative approach and collects data via an interview questionnaire. Research data are collected from interviews of six high-ranking government officials. Using the theme generating and data coding approach in ATLAS, a qualitative data analysis program, this study found that the preparedness of the Lao PDR in implementing the ASEAN Common Visa (ACV) spans nine key factors: (1) geographical location, (2) visa policy, (3) immigration control, (4) quota of foreign workers in the private sector, (5) information and communications technology (ICT) in connectivity development, (6) electronic systems in the consular sector, (7) infrastructure, (8) population mobility, and (9) attitudes towards the ACV. After categorizing these factors based on economic, political, and social-cultural dimensions, it was found that population mobility is a common concern among the three dimensions. This suggests that the Lao PDR needs to focus on improvements in border management, synchronization of information and communication technology, infrastructure, and human resources development among the relevant sectors. © 2020 Sciedu Press.","ASEAN; Common visa; Economic; Lao PDR; Political-security; Social-cultural",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083386112

Drawing from the tension between the EU’s attempt to achieve watertight border controls by means of biometric technologies, and migrants’ persistence to move to and live in the EU, the volume pursues two interrelated objectives: first, it studies the encounters between migrants and the Visa Information System (VIS), one of the largest biometric databases in the world, from the perspective of mobility in order to investigate how migrants appropriate mobility via Schengen visa within and against this biometric border regime. Second, it addresses criticisms of autonomy of migration in order to develop it as a viable approach for border, migration and critical security studies. Hence, the book is driven by two interrelated research questions: what does the assertion of moments of autonomy of migration refer to in the context of border regimes that use biometrics to turn migrants’ bodies into a means of mobility control? And how do migrants appropriate mobility via Schengen visa within and against biometric border regimes? This book will be of great interest to scholars in border, migration and critical security studies, as well as researchers engaged in citizenship studies, surveillance studies, political theory, critical IR theory and international political sociology. © 2019 Stephan Scheel.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068407605

Especially at airports, automated border control, more commonly known as e-gates, have been taken widely into use. With e-gates, travelers perform border check as self-service, and the role of the border guards is to monitor or possibly also assist travelers passing the border. The introduction of automated systems significantly reshapes current ways of conducting border control from the border guard’s perspective, and automation thus requires new skills from them. Understanding the effects of automation on the work tasks and work performance of border guards requires thorough examination. This paper introduces key Human Factors issues affecting border guard and border control system performance. The results are based on literature review and field studies conducted in different border control points within six European countries.

But while its effects are well examined in migration and border studies, less is known about the intricate ways in which biometric bordering is politically negotiated and socio-technically put into practice. Therefore, in this paper, I trace the contested emergence of one particular scheme of biometric border control currently in the making: the EU’s Smart Borders Package. Proposed by the European Commission in 2013, it aims at digitally registering all third-country nationals’ entries to and exits from the Schengen area, while simultaneously accelerating the border crossing of certain travellers. I argue that, unlike other forms of biometric bordering, the Smart Borders Package problematises border control primarily on the level of its temporalities and constitutes the speed of border crossings, the timing of control as well as third-country nationals’ duration of stay as distinct objects of governing. Meanwhile, the project’s political negotiations have sparked techno-political controversies that repeatedly brought it to the brink of failure. Yet, these controversies have significantly enhanced the intelligibility and practicability of biometric bordering, contributing to the emergence of what I call the self-service border. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Biometrics; border control; EU smart border; technology; temporality","biometry; border region; European Union; immigration policy; international migration; technology adoption; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035140474

This article transposes on-site border malfunctions into the antecedent register of research and development in order to explore how failure operates in the design, construction and testing of a border security technology. Drawing from extensive ethnographic research of a European-wide project to develop the Handhold portable chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive (CBRNE) detector, this article traces how failure is mobilized as an instructive experience in the professional cultures of science, engineering and governance, and retrospectively narrated as a necessary step on the road to eventual success. In exploring the limitations of this understanding, the article demonstrates how competing experiences of failure constantly trouble the daily routines of scientists and engineers, shape informal de-risking strategies, and fuel the relentless pursuit of innovation. To contest the dominant account of failure as an instructive experience, the article argues that more creative and critical research into the heterogeneous life-worlds of failure is needed in order to politicize the consequences of border failures and connect them to the antecedent register of scientific research and development. © The Author(s) 2017.","Borders; failure; innovation; risk; security; technology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046008324

Many examples of DAQ systems are monolithic processes that run on a computer attached to the DAQ hardware. In this new DAQ, a different process is assigned to each task of the system (e.g. data acquisition, pre-processing, analysis, high-voltage management...). The communication between the processes is obtained through dedicated communication sockets. An important advantage of this approach is the possibility to distribute the system over several computers connected in a network, in order to distribute the computational load. The distributed nature of the system allows also the implementation of on-line data analysis processes that can be computationally intensive. Moreover the system is very versatile, as the different tasks can be dynamically activated or disabled, and robust, since a failure of one of the processes does not jeopardize the whole system. The system has been used in the project to acquire the data generated by fast signal digitizers. Excellent results were obtained, both in terms of performance (e.g. maximum acquisition rates) and stability. The project entitled 'effective Container inspection at BORDer control points' (C-BORD) is funded by the European H2020 program. Its aim is to develop a comprehensive set of technologies for the generalized Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) of containers and large-volume freight at the EU border. © 2017 IEEE.","C-BORD; Digitizer; Distributed DAQ","C (programming language); Computer hardware; Containers; Data acquisition; Information management; Medical imaging; Signal processing; Acquisition rates; Computational loads; Container inspection; Digitizers; Distributed DAQ; Distributed data acquisition; Non-intrusive inspection; On-line analysis; Distributed computer systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058490428

We argue that border security drones have contrary political, policy, and ethical implications. First, the encroachment of military technologies into non-military security operations may have adverse security repercussions, but drones may also save migrants' lives as they make dangerous journeys through deserts and across rough seas. Second, drone surveillance erodes privacy but also creates new accountability mechanisms. Finally, drones may obviate some visible signs of security, such as fences, while also introducing an invisible security apparatus that extends beyond state boundaries. These contradictory effects help to explain the complex policy formation processes underlying drone border security programs in the United States and Europe, as well as the challenge of reaching clear answers about whether drone security is desirable. © The Author(s) (2018).

Afirmamos que los drones destinados a la vigilancia de las fronteras tienen implicaciones políticas, éticas y reglamentarias opuestas. En primer lugar, la intrusión de las tecnologías militares en las operaciones de seguridad no militares puede tener repercusiones negativas en materia de seguridad, pero al mismo tiempo, los drones pueden salvar las vidas de los inmigrantes que emprenden un peligroso viaje en el que cruzan desiertos y mares embravecidos. En segundo lugar, la vigilancia con drones reduce la privacidad, pero también permite crear nuevos mecanismos de responsabilidad. Por último, los drones pueden pasar por alto señales visibles de seguridad, como las vallas, a la vez que introducen un sistema de vigilancia invisible que va más allá de las fronteras nacionales. Estos efectos contradictorios ayudan a explicar los complejos procesos de creación de políticas que están detrás de los programas de vigilancia de las fronteras con drones de Estados Unidos y Europa, así como el desafío de obtener respuestas claras acerca de la idoneidad de la seguridad con drones. © The Author(s) (2018).

It is gradually becoming a commonplace particularly at air borders, where the concept of self-service has had the strongest business case also in other steps of the passenger's journey, such as check-in or baggage drop. Besides providing a means to enhance efficiency and security in passenger clearing processes, the new technology significantly reshapes current ways of conducting border checks from employee perspective. Successful implementation of automated border check technologies thus demands border organizations to equip their workforce with new skills and remodel existing ones. This paper presents a preliminary analysis on current technology training of border guards and assesses its effects on how the new technology is received among employees at the frontline. The results are based on field studies conducted in five EU member states.

Through a case study of Spain's SIVE (Sistema Integrado de Vigilancia del Exterior) surveillance system, I tease apart the Guardia Civil's technocratic claims of omni-voyance by focusing on the daily interactions between border guards, vision technologies, rescue services, Moroccan forces, and the lively materials of the borderspace itself. I employ a literary narrative in order to expose the daily breaches of control as the guards and technologies contend with the non-human elements of the borderspace, as well as their own inability to remain vigilant. Far from offering unbroken control, therefore, I argue that the vision produced through SIVE is stuttered and fragmented through both human and technological flaws. I also draw on assemblage theory in order to trace the disparate actors being drawn into the border regime. I argue that these new actors are only ever partially encountered and incorporated, however, and that as a result the system's ability to incorporate also becomes its Achilles heel. The effect is a geography of the border that foregrounds the ‘little details’ of borderwork and the volatility of the borderspace itself – thus exposing the flaws behind a scopic narrative that claims unceasing vision and an unhindered reach. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,"border region; maritime boundary; political geography; surveillance and enforcement; territorial management; territoriality; theoretical study; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047465821

Medicine has not been at the core of recent EU-funded efforts in central Europe, partially due to significant differences in health care administration, delivery, reimbursement, and culture. However, impeding changes in social structure and centralization of specialized care warrant changes in preclinical administration of medical care, which are already transforming practices across developed countries in central Europe. Moreover, demographic and social changes are transforming not only patients but also health care providers, thus leading to an increased need for specialized medical personnel, particularly in regions close to formerly secluding borders. The EU-funded cooperation project presented in this article is located in the Euroregion Pomerania, which consists of northeastern Germany and northwestern Poland. This project emerged because of the need to solve practical emergency medicine–related problems for many years, which brought partners together. Unfortunately, administrative and medical interaction has not become significantly easier with Poland joining the Schengen area in 2007 and, subsequently, initial international contracts regarding, among other things, emergency medicine being negotiated and signed thereafter. Three different interdependent areas of cooperation within the project deal with key aspects of an improved and eventually integrated cooperation. An accepted clarification of administrative and legal foundations – or the lack and thus the need thereof – needs to be defined. Specialized language and simulation-based education and practice sessions employing modern technology throughout will be introduced to the entire region. Finally, the pre-existing and developing acceptance and sustainability aspects of personnel involved in the aforementioned actions and stakeholders on both sides of the border will be evaluated. In essence, the project focuses on a multimodal improvement of professional cooperation of key providers of emergency medicine services in the Euroregion Pomerania. Thereby, it aims to improve infrastructure; interpersonal and professional skills of involved personnel, administrative, and cultural relations; and eventually identification of specialized personnel with their workplace and region to secure and retain important medical workforce in an otherwise remote area on both sides of a formerly secluded border. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","emergency medicine; integrated cross-border care; joint language and interprofessional training; paramedic education; simulation environment; sustainable continued education","ambulance; developed country; emergency health service; emergency medicine; Germany; health care delivery; health care management; health care quality; human; interpersonal communication; language development; patient information; Poland; priority journal; reimbursement; Review; rural area; simulation training; vocational education; work environment; workplace; emergency medicine; European Union; forecasting; health care personnel; standards; telemedicine; trends; Delivery of Health Care; Emergency Medicine; European Union; Forecasting; Health Personnel; Humans; Telemedicine; Workforce",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046655217

As part of a securitisation process, these measures are often expanded upon and justified in terms of economic threat that aims to restrain ‘opportunist Central East European migrants’, who are associated with welfare dependence and cheap labour. Although unemployed Roma migrants are exposed to social exclusion due to the stigma of ‘benefit shoppers’, this paper explores how current neoliberal labour market structures facilitate new securitisation processes and fuel the precarity of Roma, even if they are employed in the host country. Based on a multi-sited ethnography completed in The United Kingdom, it will be illustrated how communitarianism of Member States stratifies the moral values of migrants’ labour in a manner that defines the preconditions of social inclusion of newcomers in host societies. In short, this paper argues that even for migrants who are not welfare dependent and who are self-sustaining, their social inclusion is defined by engagement in the sort of labour that is culturally acknowledged by the host society. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.","communitarianism; precarity; securitisation; social sorting",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044534866

We reflect this questionable situation against the notion of the good society and consider airports as normatively laden socio-physical zones contributing to experiences of exclusion. Our research stresses the need to consider human abilities as a spectrum, which should be addressed with the use of universal design principles to benefit as many travelers as possible.

Digital migration studies is an emerging interdisciplinary field focussed on studying migration in, through and by means of the internet. As the so-called European refugee crisis demonstrates, the scale, intensities and types of transnational migration and digital networking have drastically changed in recent years. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have fundamentally transformed migration processes and vice versa. Top-down management of migration flows and border control is increasingly dependent on digital technologies and datafication, while from the bottom-up migrants use smart phones and apps to access information, maintain transnational relations, establish local connections and send remittances. In the first half of the chapter, drawing on (Candidatu et al., 2018) we distinguish between three paradigms of digital migration studies: (1) migrants in cyberspace; (2) everyday digital migrant life; (3) migrants as data. In the second half of the chapter, we offer the methodological research principles of relationality, adaptability and ethics-of-care to operationalize digital migration studies with a commitment to social justice. Challenging unjust power relations is important both when studying vulnerable groups as well as studying elites. The many experiences, obstacles and opportunities we found in the literature reveal that the future of digital migration studies lies at the intersection of big and small data, there is great urgency in triangulating quantified patterns with in-depth narrative accounts and situated experiences. © The Author(s) 2018.","Digital Migration; Digital Practices; Emerging Research Focus; European Refugee Crisis; Information And Communication Technologies (ICTs)",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076620966

In the age of big data, automated processing of information, large-scale use of algorithms and profiling systems, the risk of losing control over data and the fear of activities carried out in violation of the rights of the individuals, are very real. Over the last two years, in the context of the initiative that led to the adoption of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR) and in some parts of a study commissioned by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) on the use of certain investigative tools by Law Enforcement agencies, data protection has been in the center of the legal debate. The GDPR places the person in the core of its protection system, and protects the individuals through the protection of their data. The LIBE Commission study, while moving from a different point of view more connected to the protection of civil rights during investigations, evaluates, at some point, the risks of individual's data processing without proper guarantees.

Author believes that the system of EU legal acts regulating visa relations should be qualified as EU visa legislation, which is one of the elements of a larger system of legal acts in the field of freedom of movement of persons. The EU visa policy has two key areas: the establishment of a visa / visa-free entry regime; the establishment of the procedure and conditions for issuing short stay visas. The latter area also includes issues related to the functioning of the Visa Information System. Currently, the EU realizes the reform of the visa policy, which covers both its directions. The analysis of the ongoing reform shows that the EU, on the one hand, seeks to strengthen external borders by creating additional control mechanisms, and. on the other hand, as a compensatory measure, creates more comfortable conditions for the entry of frequent and law-abiding travelers. © 2018 Institute of Europe Russian Academy of Sciences.

It further contends that high-end technologies such as drones introduce a military bias as security enablers in border surveillance and as a panacea for the consequences of failed policies to manage irregular migration.

The analysis comes in a situation, where there are multiple regulations, directives, guidelines; but it lacks a unified standard for the implementation of the member states subsystems. The main finding is that a separate standard is not necessary; however, there is a need for setting minimum requirements, ensuring security of the information systems, that come with appropriate guidelines that help the member states to achieve the minimum requirements. The second finding is that there is a need for greater cooperation and an increased knowledge exchange of the methods used in the member states.

While biometrics enrolment of asylum seekers is taking place sporadically throughout Europe, policies are not enforced uniformly, allowing migrant obscurity and creating failures in identifying nefarious actors. We explored gaps via the analysis of anonymous databases, news outlets and professional experience in the field. The geographic focus is on Germany and the border free region known as the Schengen Area. The conclusion is that the proper use of biometrics increases security, while ignoring them could lead to catastrophic results. © 2018 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

The so called ""failures to enroll"" at capturing biometric data reveal a construction of the ""normal"" body, while other bodies appear as less technologically compatible.

What the notion of appropriation better captures than concepts like agency or resistance is the multi-faceted and intricate intertwinement of border regimes and migratory practices. The article illustrates this advantage through an analysis of the phenomenon of bezness. The term refers to a migration strategy of aspiring migrants who seduce and subsequently marry European tourists as a way to gain entry to and residency in Europe. This article develops a reading of bezness as a mode of appropriation of mobility which is intertwined with the border regime in at least four ways: First, bezness is provoked by restrictive visa policies that create a highly unequal access to mobility and life opportunities. The case of bezness illustrates, second, that migrants try to recode the methods, logics and effects of mobility control into means of appropriation. Migrants' practices of appropriation involve, third, the clandestine transgression of the norms, rules and regulations that define particular border regimes. Finally, the notion of appropriation permits to recognize that the European border regime operates as an apparatus of capture that tries to recuperate migrants' practices in order to turn them into a driving force for its own development. The example of bezness demonstrates, moreover, that these processes of recuperation also feature the mobilization of emotions-in this case of romantic love-as technologies of government. © The Author 2017.

The ways in which the emerging transnational policies of migration management are actually put into practice and are thereby shaped by implementing actors, as well as the contexts to which they have been applied, have received less attention. Against this background, the article turns to the IOM's contested implementation of migration management in Morocco. As such, it aims to extend the dominant focus of most studies on state and EU institutions, their policy, discourse and decision making towards the border zones in which their practical outcome and meaning is negotiated. Using the example of two projects implemented by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), it reconstructs the negotiation processes of international migration management on the ground. Based on the analysis of emerging control practices in Morocco, the article shows how humanitarian and neoliberal logics of governing migration complement existing security-oriented policies and, as such, contribute to the (re)stabilization and expansion of the trans- Mediterranean migration regime in times of fading legitimacy. With theoretical reference to the concept of a migration regime, the article argues that these reconfigurations are neither the result of a centrally directed 'EUropean masterplan' nor of a linear evolution towards more sophisticated control technologies but the contingent outcome of struggles between migration movements and the political and administrative attempts to control them. © The Author 2017.

Based on an analysis of documents published by EU institutions and independent organizations, I argue that these technological innovations fundamentally alter the nature of national borders. I discuss how new technologies of vision are deployed to transcend the physical limits of territories. In the last twenty years, EU member states and institutions have increasingly relied on various forms of remote tracking, including the use of drones for the purposes of monitoring frontier zones. In combination with other facets of the EU border management regime (such as transnational databases and biometrics), these technologies coalesce into a system of governance that has enabled intervention into neighboring territories and territorial waters of other states to track and target migrants for interception in the “prefrontier.” For jurisdictional reasons, this practice effectively precludes the enforcement of legal human rights obligations, which European states might otherwise have with regard to these persons. This article argues that this technologically mediated expansion of vision has become a key feature of post–cold war governance of borders in Europe. The concept of transterritory is proposed to capture its effects. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","borders; drones; European Union; Eurosur; surveillance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031945245

With effect, from 7 April, a new EU rule (Regulation 2017/458) has reinforced checks against relevant databases at external borders. This makes checking EU citizens and their travel documents against databases compulsory, enhanced with biometric checks where needed. It means that at the border gates, instead of checking EU citizens randomly, they should all be checked. The solutions identified by the project include the pre-arrival registration and the biometric identification of people to speed up the process1 and wearable intelligent border control equip­ment that will allow the capacity for control to be enlarged, even where the infrastructure can­not be physically extended by increasing the head­count of the border control force. The Intelligent Portable Control System pro­ject has led to a series of findings about the best application of different biometric modalities in border control. The project has also explored the issues around introducing these innovations. The imple­mentation process is complex, encompassing not only novel biometric solutions but also related biometric analytics, detection and com­munication tools. Consequently, and based on the results of the end user requirements collection, the project assumes the implementation of a face-matching tool, palm vein scanner, fingerprint recognition and an automatic deception detection system. Biometric technologies offer a potential solution to deliver high security lev­els while minimising the impact on travellers’ transit time. The proposed Intelligent Portable Control System aims to achieve this, enabling faster and more thorough border control for third-country nationals crossing the land borders of EU member states.",,"Control systems; Pattern recognition; Biometric checks; Biometric identifications; Biometric technology; Deception detection; End user requirements; Fingerprint Recognition; Terrorist threats; Travel documents; Biometrics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024475231

This article engages with what we call the ‘operative vision’ of surveillance at sea, specifically as performed by the border control apparatus in the Aegean. We analyse the political consequences of this operative vision by elaborating on three examples of fieldwork conducted in the Aegean and on the islands of Chios and Lesbos. One of the main aims is to bring the figure of the migrant back into the study of border technologies. By combining insights from science and technology studies with border, mobility and security studies, the article distinguishes between processes of intervention, mobilization and realization and emphasizes the role of migrants in their encounter with surveillance operations. Two claims are brought forward. First, engaging with recent scholarly work on the visual politics of border surveillance, we circumscribe an ongoing ‘transactional politics’. Second, the dynamic interplay between vision and action brings about a situation of ‘recalcitrance’, in which mobile objects and subjects of various kinds are drawn into securitized relations, for instance in encounters between coast guard boats and migrant boats at sea. Without reducing migrants to epiphenomena of those relations, this recalcitrance typifies the objects of surveillance as both relatable as well as resistant, particularly in the tensions between border control and search and rescue. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Aegean; border surveillance; irregular migration; politics; visualization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020118309

Although both countries have important agreements to promote economic exchange and trade, the events of 9/11 and other acts of terrorism have increased concerns about border security. Since the US-Mexico border is one of the most important borders in the world in terms of activity, securing it without interfering with the legitimate flow of people and goods, poses an important challenge. The purpose of this paper is to propose conceptual frameworks and models to facilitate collaboration across national borders, by discussing and considering key factors for collaborative US-Mexico Border Security Infrastructure and Systems. Border security technical solutions pose an interesting domain because there are a myriad of concerns (e.g., political, economic, social and cultural) outside the technical implementation that must be deliberated and examined. In this conceptual study, unique aspects of trust, governance, information sharing, culture, and technical infrastructure are identified as the key ingredients in a cross-border collaboration effort. A bi-national organizational network appears to be an effective institutional design to develop a better understanding of the problem, as well as required policies and technologies. This approach is consistent with experiments, research, and conclusions found in the European Union. © 2017 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021377740

In order to verify whether the transported goods match the transport declaration, X-ray imaging of containers is used at many customs site worldwide. The main objective of the research and development project 'Automated Comparison of X-ray Images for Cargo Scanning (ACXIS)', which is funded by the European 7th Framework Program, is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the inspection procedures of cargo at customs using X-ray technology. The current inspection procedures are reviewed to identify risks, catalogue illegal cargo, and prioritize detection scenarios. Based on these results, we propose an integrated solution that provides automation, information exchange between customs administrations, and computer-based training modules for customs officers. Automated target recognition (ATR) functions analyze the X-ray image after a scan is made to detect certain types of goods such as cigarettes, weapons and drugs in the freight or container. Other helpful information can also be provided, such as the load homogeneity, total or partial weight, or the number of similar items. The ATR functions are provided as an option to the user. The X-ray image is transformed into a manufacturer-independent format through geometrical and spectral corrections and stored into a database along with the user feedback and other related data. This information can be exchanged with similar systems at other sites, thus facilitating information exchange between customs administrations. The database is seeded with over 30'000 examples of legitimate and illegal goods. These examples are used by the ATR functions through machine learning techniques, which are further strengthened by the information exchange. In order to improve X-ray image interpretation competency of human operators (customs officers), a computer-based training software is developed that simulates these new inspection procedures. A study is carried out to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the computer-based training as well as the implemented procedures. Officers from the Dutch and Swiss Customs administrations partake in the study, covering both land and sea borders. © 2016 IEEE.","automated target recognition; cargo inspection; computer-based training standardization; Customs border control; image; security screening; simulation; X-ray image analysis; X-ray screening","Automation; Computer aided analysis; Containers; Crime; E-learning; Efficiency; Information dissemination; Inspection; Learning systems; Personnel training; Risk perception; X ray analysis; X ray screens; Automated target recognition; Border control; Cargo inspection; Computer - based trainings; image; Security screening; simulation; X-ray image; X-ray screening; Image analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011660187

One critical application domain for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) streaming is border security, mapping and precise agriculture. Regarding the first issue, the current political evolutions in the wide region of south eastern European territory reveals the significance for a wide surveillance. This is also valid in agriculture to get a more precise and high quality production. However, efficient access to video data located on Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAVs) and real-time streaming is an arduous task due to large bandwidth requirements imposed by the video sequences and the unstable capacity and bandwidth of the wireless channel. In addition, the traditional representation of a video sequence as a stream of consecutive frames is not reliable for new emerging applications needed in aerial vehicles such as content indexing, retrieval and non-linear access and browsing. This reveals the need for the implementation of non-linear tools enabling the efficient summarization of the visual content. Summarization refers to the process of creating compact summaries of the Audio-Video (AV) content that facilitate discovery, browsing and navigation of the AV content. In this paper, we propose a fast video summarization algorithm that enables the extraction of key frames from UAV-captured videos. The algorithm exploits the curvature of the magnitude of visual feature trajectory to detect content fluctuations both in time and in space.

The analysis draws from a set of thinking tools developed by the sociology of association in the field of science and technology studies. The contribution argues that in order to grasp policy outcomes such as smart borders, security studies would benefit from adopting a compositional outlook on agency, where action is seen as the effect of associated entities. Looking at the smartening of EU borders, the article finds that this process is held together by multiple translations and enrolments through which the technical side of dataveillance – platforms, automated gates, matching systems, and so forth – has become associated with the processes of policymaking on border security and sustains the furtherance of mass dataveillance. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","European Union; smart borders; sociology of association; surveillance; technology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982924133

Box 90153, Tilburg, 5000 LE, Netherlands","Record numbers of migrants and refugees fleeing violence and poverty in parts of Africa and the Middle East present the European Union with unprecedented challenges, including in determining their identity as well as status. In recent years problems of identifying immigrants have been addressed in order to fight identity fraud and illegal entry of migrants. As a result, a wide variety of digital systems have been introduced to orchestrate an effective, preventative modus of identification of migrants. Digital systems are in particular geared towards spotting those migrants who (are about to) commit identity fraud or who enter the territory of EU member states illegally. Although the key aim of the digital systems is framed to protect the administrative, geographic and legal borders of the member state and the safety of its population, empirically based studies demonstrate that these systems bring new risks for migrants themselves. This article intends to contribute to the discussion on the use of digital systems for managing the movement of migrants by analysing identification and risk assessment systems from the perspective of the new European data protection regime and the European Convention on Human Rights. For this purpose, two identification systems - the so-called INS console within the Dutch immigration and border sector, and the PROGIS console within the law enforcement sector - are analysed. A third is the Advanced Passenger Information system operated at Schiphol Airport by border control and immigration services. Against the background of the position of many migrants finding themselves at risk in their home country and of the two legislative frameworks mentioned above, this article addresses two issues. First, the analysis focuses on how migrants are perceived by digital monitoring practices: are they themselves at risk, non-risk or do they pose a risk? In the EU, migrants must prove that their case is worthy of asylum status because they are 'at risk' from political unrest or other life-threatening circumstances in their home country. Yet, empirical data gathered through semi-structured interviews show that simply abiding by the standards during an enrolment process of the INS console, rather than being 'at risk', a migrant can easily be categorised as 'posing a risk' (La Fors-Owczynik & Van der Ploeg, 2015). Second, this article aims to investigate what the capacity of the new data protection regime is in protecting migrants from being framed as 'a risk' or a 'misfit' stemming from the use of digital systems. Given this second aim, the following discussion also intends to explore the extent to which the European Convention on Human Rights can provide an additional legal remedy for migrants being digitally categorised in a manner that is detrimental to them. © 2016 Karolina La Fors-Owczynik.","Biometrics; Border control; Data protection; Human rights; Identification; Immigration; Law enforcement; Migrants; Profiling; Risk","Air navigation; Biometrics; Crime; Data privacy; Identification (control systems); Law enforcement; Laws and legislation; Risks; Social aspects; Border control; Human rights; Immigration; Migrants; Profiling; Risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84966508401

For this reason, discussions on developing the legislative framework governing these matters are highly sensitive and subject to ethical controversy. At a European level there are numerous ethical challenges related to assisted reproductive technology (ART) but none related into uniform manner to be acceptable by all member countries. Methods: In this respect, we review the current legislation of the following twenty-six European countries which are also into Shengen Area: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweeden, Switzerland, other four European countries that do not form part of the Schengen Area, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania and other two like Ireland and the United Kingdom. Results: Twenty-four of the European Union member states (i.e. Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweeden, Switzerland, Bulgaria, Croatia and United Kingdom) have reported the existence of specific legislation, while 8 countries (i.e. Cyprus, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Poland, Romania, Latvia) have reported that no specific legislation exists, only general legislation covering ART procedures. Conclusions: We propose that legal systems should supplement the existing laws and adapt it to the unique challenges presented by ART, so that society may benefit from the application of ART advancement in a socially responsible and uniform ethical manner. © 2016 Romanian Society of Ultrasonography in Obstetrics and Gynecology.","Assisted reproduction; Ethical aspects; Europe; Research","Article; assisted reproductive technology; consensus development; cryopreservation; economic aspect; Europe; health care policy; human; infertility; law; legal aspect; medical ethics; medical research; nidation; reproduction; reproductive health; sperm donor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84974569625

However, it is precisely the technology deployed at the borders which paradoxically pushes illegalized travelers to zones of greater exposure to “nature.” The article explores from a cultural-sociological perspective the new configurations of technology, “culture,” and “nature” that are emerging through the EU border regime. Drawing on Agamben's category of bare life, it claims that illegalized travelers are displaced into a sphere of mere biological survival. A content and discourse analysis of the narratives attached to technological products developed for border surveillance and control reveals a symbolical construction of the illegalized traveler as contiguous to “nature” while technology is depicted as if deprived of agency. Technology and nature are often perceived as neutral, ahistorical, and value-free, but are always socially and historically constructed. This construction expresses a certain understanding of the border scenario and an underlying definition of what is “human.” The paradox between the humanitarian and the securitization paradigms is thus only apparent: both rely on the construction of the illegalized travelers as bare life. A global biopolitical schism along the boundary between “nature” and “culture”—analogous to what Latour called the “great divide” between “moderns” and “others”—is being reproduced but also disputed and negotiated along the EU borders. © 2016 Association for Borderlands Studies.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84974851814

This intensification in irregular migration has led to the design and application of a migration control policy whose instrumental and institutional structures are becoming increasingly complex. Irregular immigration at maritime borders has been addressed through what we have referred to and characterized as a multi-layered deterrence strategy which has been gradually implemented and upgraded along the main entry points and migration corridors. The Spanish strategy is tightly intertwined with the unfolding of the EU Integrated Border Management approach and combines higher inputs of surveillance and border control technologies with multilateral cooperation agreements reached with transit and origin countries. High-tech border surveillance increases interception probabilities, but effective migration deterrence is conditioned by high expulsion rates once the border has been crossed. It is in the task of border implementation that technology appears as one of the pillars of the control structure and where its effect on deterrence depends on its embeddedness in a mix of instruments and actions. © 2016 Association for Borderlands Studies.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84965082050

In contrast to claims of waning state sovereignty, drawing on detailed case studies from the United States and European Union, we argue the militarisation of borders represents a re-articulation and expansion of state sovereignty into new spaces and arenas. We argue that the nexus of military-security contractors, dramatically increased security budgets, and the discourse of threats from terrorism and immigration is resulting in a profound shift in border security. The construction of barriers, deployment of more personnel and the investment in a wide range of military and security technologies from drones to smart border technologies that attempt to monitor, identify and prevent unauthorised movements are emblematic of this shift. We link this increasing militarisation to dehumanisation of migrant others and to the increasing mortality in border spaces. By documenting this trend and identifying a range of different practices that are included under the rubric of militarisation, this paper is both a call for nuanced interpretation and more sustained investigation of the expansion of the military into the policing of borders. © 2016 Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers).","Borders; European Union; Militarisation; Political geography; USA","border region; European Union; military government; political geography; regional security; sovereignty; Europe; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961203772

This article takes a close look at one way in which officials try to overcome such conflicts: through technology. In West Africa, the secure ‘Seahorse’ network hardwires border cooperation into a satellite system connecting African and European forces. In Spain’s North African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, advanced border fencing has joined up actors around a supposedly impenetrable divide. And on the EU level, the ‘European external border surveillance system’, or Eurosur, papers over power struggles between agencies and states through ‘decentralized’ information-sharing – even as the system’s physical features (nodes, coordination centres, interfaces) deepen competition between them. The article shows how such technologies, rather than ‘halting migration’, have above all acted as catalysts for new social relations among disparate sectors, creating areas for collaboration and competition, compliance and conflict. With these dynamics in mind, the conclusion sketches an ‘ecological’ perspective on the materialities of border control – infrastructure, interfaces, vehicles – while calling for more research on their contradictory and often counterproductive consequences. © 2015, The Author(s) 2015.","Actor-network theory; border control; illegality; irregular migration; materiality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955597074

This agenda has been particularly instrumental in cultivating migration anxieties and framing the problem of threat as an imperative to identify those who are dangerous to public safety. As well founded as that may be, it masks the pivotal role ICTs have in the supervision and administration of industries and markets. ICTs, including biometrics, are essential to supervise all four freedoms of movement in European market integration, i.e., of goods, services, capital and persons. They are essential to the EU-US trade and investment relationship which is increasingly underpinned by cross-border data flows, and the most significant such relationship globally. Drawing on mobilities research, this chapter explores how the mobilities of materials, commodities, markets and labour are simultaneously constrained and facilitated in transnational development, including the obligation in Europe to protect the fifth freedom of movement, that of data. While a recent European regulation aims to better protect personal data in these flows, the narratives of threat and emergency call for immediate action, whereby any data that can be intercepted can also be gathered for investigative purposes on the basis of exceptional circumstance. The securitization agenda finds its practical utility in the hands of executive powers who are largely avoiding the legislature and the judiciary. There is no evidence that authorities catch terrorists and criminals because of advanced ICTs and biometry in border control and data intercept. The practical utility lies in the ability to target and investigate any individual and a whole range of political opposition and activism which has very little if anything to do with threat and emergency. Publics have no meaningful defence apart from self-censorship. They have no meaningful way of objecting to exceptional circumstances in which illiberal practices are legitimized, and neither does the legislature and the judiciary unless the checks on executive powers are adequately reined in. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Biometry; Data protection; Data-driven markets; Economic growth; Economic leadership; Executive power; Fifth freedom; Free movement of data; freedom of expression; Securitization; Surveillance",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098120956

The field has also made great strides into many different areas of psychology including developmental, clinical and organizational. The 10 years following the publication of the first edition of this Handbook has seen highly regarded psychological journals regularly publishing topics central to acculturation. Some journals in their desire to stimulate research have come out with topical issues on migration (see, e.g., Child development, 2012). As Van de Vijver et al. (Chapter 6, this volume) point out, we are witnessing an exponential increase in acculturation studies. Compared to the about 1,500 studies registered in PsycINFO during the first 100 years of acculturation psychology research, over 7,000 records could be identified following a cursory search in PsycINFO for the period from 2000 to the time of this writing. Why this increase? We tried to answer this question in the introduction to this volume (Chapter 1), where we pointed out that intercultural contacts are on the rise for several reasons. These included (1) easier and faster means for people to travel over wider distances together with bilateral agreements between nations, such as the Schengen agreement, making traveling easier, albeit amid tighter security checks; (2) developments in information technology that have brought people into contact, who until recently were very much isolated from each other; (3) the unabated but sad and traumatic man-made disasters of uprooting and relocating thousands of people because of ethnic, political and religious conflicts together with natural catastrophes that force people to flee to different regions of the world; (4) economic developments and economic meltdowns are still with us, forcing people to relocate either internally or internationally to seek greener pastures elsewhere. All these phenomena are major sources of intercultural contact, and of acculturation; hence they are of great interest to acculturation psychology. To be able to face and tackle the challenges these phenomena pose, acculturation psychology should regularly review and revise its assumptions and theories with supporting empirical research. And it is this goal that we hope this Handbook achieves. Another goal with the first edition of the Handbook was to move away from acculturation theories that have developed predominantly in one sociocultural context, such as the United States (see, e.g., Chun, Organizta & Marin, 2002; Leong, 2014). © Cambridge University Press 2016.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038880022

They flee conflicts, persecution and - of course - extreme poverty, and must therefore be welcomed, under the Geneva Convention and the Dublin Regulation. The Dublin III Regulation (No. 604/2013) is a European Union law that determines the EU Member State responsible for examining an application for asylum or refugee status under the Geneva Convention, which is usually the State through which the asylum seeker first entered the EU. Several EU countries are involved: first reception countries, such as Italy and Greece for what concerns Mediterranean migration, and other countries that grant asylum, such as Germany, followed by the UK, France, Italy and Spain. Monitoring migration flows is the most pressing issue, especially in first reception countries. A possible solution could be remote sensing of borders in migrant countries of origin, carried out by companies from destination countries. An example is the Treaty signed between Libya and Italy in 2008. A costly mechanism that, however, does not involve the use of police forces. The cost will be split between the destination country and the EU, based on existing agreements. Satellite monitoring could help save lives, enhance safety operations, counteract illegal migration, and prevent terrorists from entering the EU. All rescue and recovery operations now rely on satellite technology, and information on piracy and border control is provided in real time. Data is processed in Lisbon at the European Maritime Safety Agency, and all vessel traffic in European waters is traced by EMSA. Since the phenomenon involves Europe as a whole, and considering existing EU-ESA joint space initiatives, it would be advisable to entrust the European Space Agency with the tasks of satellite monitoring and remote sensing. The Sentinel-3 satellite - carrying sophisticated radar and optical instruments and currently used for the Copernicus environmental and security monitoring program - could also be used to locate and identify migrant vessels.",,"Binary alloys; Laws and legislation; Potassium alloys; Satellites; Space optics; Waterway transportation; European Space Agency; European Union Law; Maritime safety; Safety operations; Satellite monitoring; Satellite technology; Security monitoring; Sub-saharan africa; Remote sensing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016511349

By using the Eurodac database to reconstruct the one and only responsible Member State per asylum application Dublin II regulates the mobility of non-EU-citizens without a valid visa within the EU. We understand the present paper as an ethnographic contribution to the understanding of the socio-technological emergence of the digital border and the digitization of border conflicts. With recourse to Bruno Latour’s concepts of “blackboxing” and “immutable mobiles” we develop an analysis that allows us to describe some exemplary actor-networks of Eurodac following our multi-sited fieldwork.

This strategy has evolved along three basic lines. Cooperation with African countries (externalization) has been key to fostering fast return procedures, whereas cooperation with the EU (communitarization through joint Frontex operations) has only been complementary to national border control initiatives driven by technological innovation (technologization). An additional aspect analysed in this chapter is the emergence of a humanitarian border in the Spanish case, a scenario in which new forms of civil mobilization in defence of the human rights of migrants have emerged reactively. Particularly at the land borders in Ceuta and Melilla, the highly visible and well-documented border control practices have raised growing concerns and public debate about the violation of fundamental rights, such as non-refoulement and asylum. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Border management; Fundamental rights; Irregular migrationIrregular migration; Migration control",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006817473

In light of the refugee crises in the Mediterranean and the responses on the part of EU member states, this volume presents an in-depth reflection on European border practices and their political, social and economic consequences. Approaching borders as concepts in flux, the authors identify three main trends: the rise of security technologies such as the EUROSUR system, the continued externalization of EU security governance such as border mission training in third states, and the unfolding dynamics of accountability. The contributions show that internal security cooperation in Europe is far from consolidated, since both political oversight mechanisms and the definition of borders remain in flux. This edited volume makes a timely and interdisciplinary contribution to the ongoing academic and political debate on the future of open borders and legitimate security governance in Europe.

We are confronted with an unprecedented degree of controversy, politicization and pace of change with regard to migration and border security issues, while other internal security concerns, such as the fight against terrorism, remain on the agenda. The chapter then turns to the possible consequences of such transformation for academic study, and proposes an analytical focus on practices and diverse sites of implementation, as opposed to the traditionally dominant concern with policy-making dynamics in Brussels. In this context, we refer to borders and bordering processes as multi-dimensional phenomena that permeate spaces within and beyond the territory of the EU. Finally, the introductory chapter elaborates on the three organizing themes of technology, externalisation and accountability, which provide a fruitful cross-cutting, perspective on the increasing empirical complexity of the EU’s Area of Freedom, Security and Justice.

Cooperation between the EU, particular member states and other space-faring actors concerning space seems to be the only option to develop real capabilities since the pooling of resources is a precondition for the success. However, available research on that subject is primary focused on its economic part or political bargains, when other issues like security and interactions between technology and international affairs are omitted. Therefore, the paper discusses the transfer of European norms and ideas regarding outer space endeavours, by placing the emphasis on interactions between space affairs, security and technology on European security. In particular, the chapter surveys sectors, methods, and spheres of the European space policy, and analyses the empirical analysis of space applications and their implications for European internal security. Thus, it offers a critical technological as well as political analysis of the satellite-based capacities that the EU is currently creating, which contrasts with political statements and widely shared assumptions about the possibility of real-time “integrated border management”. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Border; Copernicus; European space policy; EUROSUR; Keywords; Outer space; Satellite imagery; Surveillance",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006743877

Changes in EU policies are not only the consequences of ‘grand moments’ of treaty and institutional changes. In order to identify and explain changes in everyday decision-making, one should complement the traditional strategic bargaining perspective on decision-making with a constructivist view on discourse or language as sources of change. With the insights of both constructivists and communication theorists, this study focuses on the identification of conditions and occurrences of deliberation in the daily running of decision-making in the EU that allow for changes facilitating the adoption of new policy instruments. In this light a study of two cases will be presented of which each has taken place in a different institutional setting. The main analysis of this study is on the drafting process of the Framework Decision on the European Evidence Warrant of 2008. The findings of this analysis will be compared to findings of another analysis. It concerns the negotiations on the Council Decision of 2008 regarding access for consultation of the Visa Information System by law enforcement authorities.

The technology is advanced and regulatory changes are underway which will allow their use in domestic airspace. As well as the functional and economic benefits of a strong civil RPAS sector, the potential benefits for the military RPAS sector are also widely recognised. Several actors have nurtured this dual-use aspect of civil RPAS development. However, concerns have been raised about the public rejecting the technology because of their association with military applications and potentially controversial applications, for example in policing and border control. In contrast with the enthusiasm for dual-use exhibited throughout the EC consultation process, the strategy for avoiding public rejection devised in its roadmap would downplay the connection between military and non-military RPAS and focus upon less controversial applications such as search and rescue. We reflect upon this contrast in the context of the European agenda of responsible research and innovation. In doing so, we do not rely upon critique of drones per se, in their neither their civil nor military guise, but explore the extent to which current strategies for managing their public acceptability are compatible with a responsible and socially beneficial development of RPAS for civil purposes. © 2014, The Author(s).","Drones; Dual-use; Responsible research and innovation; RPAS; UAV","aircraft; airplane pilot; attitude; civil rights; conflict; dual use research; ethics; Europe; human; law enforcement; legislation and jurisprudence; machiavellianism; marketing; military phenomena; procedures; public opinion; rescue work; robotics; social behavior; social control; soldier; technology; weapon; Aircraft; Attitude; Civil Rights; Dissent and Disputes; Dual Use Research; Europe; Humans; Law Enforcement; Machiavellianism; Marketing; Military Personnel; Military Science; Pilots; Public Opinion; Rescue Work; Robotics; Social Control, Formal; Social Responsibility; Technology; Weapons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948073031

Taking a sociotechnical approach, the research presents the positions of the key actants identified in relation to key controversies regarding the development of the settlement system and shows how the relations between the controversies and the positions of the actants involved in them evolve. By examining the role of ICTs in the evolution of these relations, the study seeks to illuminate the complex causalities between the social and technical aspects of cross-border capital market integration.

As a consequence, European states are restructuring their border regimes by externalizing migration management to non-EU countries beyond the border and creating new programs and policies to do so. Autonomy of Migration (AoM) offers a distinct way for thinking about border control mechanisms and goals of managing mobility. AoM does not read this off-shoring of borders through the lens of centralized and coordinated state powers, but develops an autonomous gaze that supplements these institutional readings of apparatuses of capture with a view that takes as its starting point the ways in which border architectures, institutions, and policies interact with and react to the turbulence of migrant mobilities. By engaging current EU externalization policies, this paper illustrates the shifting relationship between border control and mobility. Resumen: A pesar de las actualizaciones tecnológicas recientes de la frontera en el perímetro de la Unión Europea, la llamada ""Europa Fortaleza"", tanto como metáfora como realidad, continua sin poder controlar la migración irregular. En respuesta, los estados miembros de la Unión están restructurando sus sistemas fronterizos externalizando la gestión migratoria a países no miembros de la UE, delegando funciones de control migratorio a países fuera de la frontera europea. El enfoque de la Autonomia de la Migracion (AoM) ofrece un anáisis poco común para pensar los mecanismos de control fronterizo y sus objetivos de gestionar la movilidad humana. AoM no interpreta dicho desplazamiento de fronteras únicamente desde la óptica del poder estatal centralizado. AoM ofrece una mirada autonoma de la movilidad, complementando esas lecturas institucionales que enfatizan los aparatos de captura. Así, AoM enfatiza la turbulencia de las migraciones como parte constituyente, y no solo receptiva, de las arquitecturas, instituciones y políticas fronterizas.

We trace how sovereign decisions are enacted as assemblages in the antecedent register of device development through the everyday decisions of scientists and engineers in the laboratory, the security experts they engage, and the material components of the device itself. Drawing on in-depth interviews, observations, and ethnographic research of the EU-funded Handhold project, we explore how assumptions about the way security technologies will and should perform at the border shape the development of a portable, integrated device to detect chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosives (CBRNE) threats at borders. In disaggregating the moments of sovereign decision-making across multiple sites and times, we question the supposed linearity of how science comes out of and feeds back into the world of border security. An interrogation of competing assumptions and understandings of security threats and needs, of competing logics of innovation and pragmatism, of the demands of differentiated temporalities in detection and identification, and of the presumed capacities, behaviours, and needs of phantasmic competitors and end-users reveals a complex, circulating and co-constitutive process of device development that laboratises the border itself. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Borders; laboratories; technology; translation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938880976

This agenda has three main characteristics: usefulness, planning and stratification, and points to a new European mobility governance. This paper explores the implications and consequences of this agenda, including the critical analysis of the so-called «Hotspot approach» and other measures such as the «refugee relocation system». Confirming the trends in the last few years, the main tools in the European border management and control strategy are cooperation, policing, new control and identification technologies for the newcomers, and the «border extended bureaucracies». As a consequence, the most advanced border posts are pushed towards the South and militarized. This paper discusses the underlying racist utilitarianism contained in these European policies. Thus, Mediterranean's governmentality crystallizes in a series of mechanisms generating new forms of violence, symbolic and direct. In this context, the paper explores the parallel logics of the «will to mobility» of young migrants from the Global South who, in spite of the security web established in European policies wish and try to be part of a transnational cosmopolitan imaginary.","Border; Emergency; European Union; Immigration; Mobility",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954435526

Ethnographic data show how, for example, the today prestigious Spanish border control model in Gibraltar did not stop the problem but rather provoked the shiftof migratory flows to more dangerous routes in the Sahara and the North of Africa. Spain's problem eventually became Italy's problem and, in turn, as routes moved East, Greece's problem: a vicious cycle manifesting the failure of European policies. The author follows the life histories of migrants he worked in the route from Senegal to Morocco who, in their respective African transits, have had to face walls, borders, new surveillance technologies and cross-border mafias. Migrants' experiences signal a progressive process: the globalization and commodification of irregular routes, emerging in parallel to migratory inhibition mechanisms.","Borders; Commodification of irregularity; Migration; Refuge; «Balloon Effect»",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954425652

It discusses the rationalities of allowing entry as they are inscribed in the Schengen visa regulations and in the regulations relating to resident permits and family reunification rights in various European countries. Specifically the paper sheds light on how market veridiction results in the disciplining of human rights in these policies. The analysis is conducted through a Foucauldian governmentality framework entailing an analysis of the problematisations of immigration through market veridiction and how these are applied today to limit immigrants’ human rights. The paper then compares these rationalities to eugenic justifications for problematising immigration in the USA from 1860s onwards. This historical comparison shows how social Darwinist notions of human worth continue to function at the level of rationalities and technologies of disciplining immigrants’ human rights. The paper concludes that market veridiction makes human rights function inside a framework of (e)quality in which human worth is calculated as ‘quality’ and not as ‘equality’, and shows how migrants’ human rights are made to function as something to be earned rather than something inherent or inalienable. © 2015 Southseries Inc., www.thirdworldquarterly.com.","class; governmentality; human rights; immigration; market veridiction; social Darwinism","European Union; governance approach; human rights; immigrant population; immigration; immigration policy; policy analysis; Europe; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938542467

Design/methodology/approach – This paper draws on extensive background research and qualitative in-depth interviews conducted in 2013 for the European Union (EU) FP-7 project “FastPass – A harmonized, modular reference system for all European automatic border crossing points”. Findings – The Smart Borders proposal not only compounds the individual concerns related to the use of biometrics in border controls and automatisation thereof, but also has serious issues of its own, premier among which is the imposition of a two-tier border control system. Social implications – The paper is a catalyst for open debate on the fundamental questions of how we got to this point and where do we want to go. It questions the process by which the increased use of IT in border controls has become the norm and policy trend in Europe, and discusses where the limits could be drawn from a fundamental rights perspective. In particular, it warns against the institutionalisation of a two-tier border control system among third-country nationals. Originality/value – Little attention is given to the fundamental rights concerns raised for EU and non-EU citizens as related to biometrics and their use in ABCs, and how these issues are reproduced in the Smart Borders proposal.

The first is the emerging notion of humanitarian 'migrant-centredness' found in the policies of elites and security professionals in the field of EUropean border security and migration management. The second is the use of animalised metaphors and imagery that pervade narratives of 'irregular' migrants' embodied experiences of detention across and beyond EUrope. It argues that what is at stake in this juxtaposition is more than simply a discrepancy between the 'rhetoric' of neoliberal bordering and the 'reality' of 'irregular' migrants' experiences. Such a view, which is commonly held among diverse critics of border violence, ultimately makes a problematic appeal back to the very humanitarian frame that has already been coopted by authorities associated with or even complicit in that violence. Seeking an alternative diagnosis and ground for critique beyond the 'rhetoric/reality' bind, the analysis draws on conceptual resources found in (post)biopolitical theory - particularly Jacques Derrida's concept of 'zoopolitics' - in order to identify and explore animalisation as a specific spatial technology of power. Understanding the work that the zoopolitical threshold does in shaping contemporary spaces of incarceration and producing animalised subjects offers new insights into both governmental logics of border security and the limits of humanitarian-based critiques. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Biopolitics; Borders; Humanitarianism; Migration; Security; Sovereignty",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84914171489

The tools of complexity science are brought to bear and mathematical and computer models are developed both for the elements and for an integrated whole. Models are developed at a variety of scales ranging from the global and international trade through a European model of inter-sub-regional migration to piracy in the Gulf and the London riots of 2011. The models embrace the changing technology of international shipping, the impacts of migration on economic development along with changing patterns of military expenditure and development aid. A unique contribution is the level of spatial disaggregation which presents each of 200+ countries and their mutual interdependencies - along with some finer scale analyses of cities and regions.

Elections are won or lost based on political parties’ perceived (in)ability to secure Australian borders, especially from asylum seekers coming to Australia by boat (Manne, The Comment: Asylum seekers, 2010). Elsewhere across the Western world, border policing and regulating mobile bodies are also a priority, creating modern ‘factories of exclusion’ (Engbersen 2001) based on hi-tech mechanisms of social segregation, especially surveillance (see Broeders 2007; Koslowski 2004). With a budget over ε 320 million set for drone development (Waterfield, EU ‘spent ε 320 million on surveillance drone development’, 2014), we are witnessing ‘an emerging EU drone policy’ (Hayes et al., EURODRONES Inc, 2014;) that gradually spills across the border, to the neighbouring countries of Global South. This chapter looks at the process of re-bordering of both Global North and Global South through case studies of Australia and Serbia. It highlights the development of security and surveillance border control technologies in both countries, especially in the context of the usage of drones in border policing. The chapter’s purpose is not to offer a comparative analysis of two case studies; rather, it seeks to illuminate the issue of drone use in border policing from opposing sides of the borderland. The chapter presents preliminary findings from a research project that looks at mobility and border control in Western Balkans in the context of the European Union (EU) integration, conducted in the period August-December 2013. It also draws on the analysis of media reporting on drones in Serbia and Australia in the past 2 years, in order to explore predominant narratives around the usage of surveillance technologies in border control. This chapter argues that, although the rhetoric in the use of drones in two contexts is largely different, the military rhetoric underpins both military and non-military use of drones. Finally, the chapter begins to examine the impact of surveillance-based, drone-led border policing on mobile bodies caught in the ‘drone stare’ (Wall and Monahan). © 2016 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Australia; Border security; Frontex; Maritime surveillance; Migration control; Serbia; The fortress europe",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017056111

Border surveillance is one of the top priorities of the member states of the EU for several reasons: the most prominent is the fight against irregular migration and cross-border crime. Within this context, public agencies (at both the national and the European level) are investing important resources in deploying the most up-to-date technologies, in an attempt to stop undesired migrants. The deployment of drones for border policing purposes is already a reality in the USA, and also in some EU member states. Frontex has also devoted attention and resources to exploring the possibility of deploying drones in border surveillance, as they are seen as beneficial assets in the perspective of European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR). The aim of this chapter is to explore the recent developments constituted by the deployment of drone technology in border surveillance. The chapter first introduces the actors, policies and practices in the sphere of border management, specifically in the area of border surveillance (1); then it discusses the use of drone technology for border surveillance, looking not only at its potentialities but also at its current shortcomings (2); it will then move toward the regulatory framework enabling the safe deployment of drones under aviation law and on border surveillance (3) and presents the constraints represented by fundamental rights and data protection rules on drone technology and the challenges drones represent for the human rights of migrants (4), before concluding that drone technology might entail a further securitisation of border surveillance, together with a shift toward preventive border surveillance (5). © 2016 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Border surveillance; Data protection; Drones; EUROSUR; Frontex; Operation mare nostrum; Privacy; RPAS; Schengen borders code; UAVs",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017047610

Other issues may also be examined, such as landuse planning around a site’s area, emergency response measures etc. This work takes into account results of various European Union-funded programs on cross-border infrastructure, as well as the author’s own research on these issues. It gradually becomes clear that statistical approaches should constitute only the basic steps towards integrated monitoring and management systems. New avenues now open in the field of environment and energy. There is a need for education and training about infrastructures, materials, monitoring systems etc. These new avenues certainly require sound and peaceful planning procedures, along with a spirit of mutual understanding and good will. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.",,"Energy management; Energy resources; Education and training; Emergency response measures; Environment and energies; Environmental monitoring system; Environmental stability; Integrated monitoring; Mathematical approach; Technological components; Monitoring",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943223759

The European Commission has recently proposed a legislative package on “EU Smart Borders” composed of an Entry-Exit System (EES) and the Registered Travellers Programme (RTP). This article examines the ways in which the EU Smart Borders reframe the traditional understandings and configurations of the EU border control system and its migration management toolkit of technologies. It is argued that smart borders take us a step further in the re-framing of mobility and identity controls in the EU Schengen apparatus. EU discourses backing up these measures have not been so much centered on the insecuritization of irregular immigration. They have instead questioned the effectiveness of the existing EU border regime, and used a “de-securitization” and facilitation of the mobility discourse hiding “discrimination by default.” Smart borders aim at identifying the future potential “irregular overstayer” and generalizing the management of mobility and identity of all non-EU travelers by implementing a person-driven approach. This approach transforms the essence of border controls in Europe and reframes the EU travel documents policy by moving away from a nationality-based approach of border controls towards another based on risk and profiling. © 2015 Association for Borderlands Studies.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930576005

In the period of real socialism it represented a genuine development barriers and obstacles of cross-border cooperation. After both countries joined the EU (2004) and the Schengen area (2007), the importance of boundaries as barriers significantly weakened. The joint research team of Czech and Polish geographers evaluated the permeability of 100 km long sections of the border according to the criteria for which are publicly available data and GIS processing technology. Following criteria were used for the border permeability evaluation: the presence of orographic or hydrologic barriers in two levels of intensity, the number of road crossings, the number of other crossings, the availability of the inland roads, contrast of population density in the border micro-regions, the number of entrepreneurs from the neighboring country in the villages on the other side of the border, the number of solved micro-projects and the number of solved large projects. Numerical characteristics of criteria were transferred to score and the resulting values are divided into three levels of permeability, while using 1) the same weights of criteria and 2) the doubled weights of the key criteria. Cartographic presentation of the results then showed persistent difficulties with permeability especially in the central section of the Czech-Polish border. © 2015, Asociatia Geographia Technica.

Scenarios are often used to deal with uncertainty. A novel backcasting methodology has been tested in which a normative objective (e.g. adaptive water management) is backcasted within the context of exploratory scenarios that sketch four different plausible futures (Economy First, Policy Rules, Fortress Europe, and Sustainability Eventually). The main advantage of combining exploratory and normative scenarios is in the identification of robust actions: actions that are effective in the different socio-environmental contexts sketched in the exploratory scenarios. This paper has three objectives: (1) to present the methodology, focussing on its novel aspects (2) to test the methodology and evaluate its perceived success by analysing organiser and stakeholder feedback and (3) to analyse and evaluate the results, in order to study the impact of the exploratory scenarios on the backcasting results and the added value of robust actions. The methodology was successfully tested in 9 local and one regional case study in a water project water scenarios for Europe and for Neighbouring States (SCENES). Results showed that the exploratory scenarios influenced the content of the backcasts, thus making the identification of robust strategies possible. The list of robust strategies includes both technological and social/organisational strategies, highlighting the need for an integrated approach. The approach shows high potential, but as the methodology is in its infancy more research is needed, particularly in methods to facilitate and monitor information flow between exploratory scenarios and backcasts. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Backcasting; Exploratory scenarios; Participation; Policy development; Robust strategies; Water management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84918514740
