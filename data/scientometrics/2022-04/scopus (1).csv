Drawing on the concept of border performativity, this article discusses how data is transforming the border. In particular, the article focuses on 1) how the EU JHA databases are evolving, from separate systems each with one purpose to multi-purpose databases, and 2) how the new EU plan – the interoperability regulation – connects and merges biometric and biographical data, as part of a shift from a silo-based approach towards a single centralised information system. The article - based on results of several research projects carried out between 2011 and 2019 adopting mixed methodology - discusses the border crossers’ role in challenging this digital border control, both in light of the current practices of data collection and processing and newly approved EU regulations. The article argues that the transformation of border control practices into practices driven by data processing makes it more difficult for border crossers to manoeuvre the system and legally challenge decisions based on data processing, thus, hampering the transformation of the border from below. © The Author(s) 2022.","borders; crimmigration; databases; European union; technology",,"Ferraris, V.; Law Department, Italy; email: valeria.ferraris@unito.it",,"SAGE Publications Inc.",14773708,,,,"English","Eur.

Following common threads about infrastructural politics across Science and Technology Studies, political geography and critical security studies, we explore fragility and maintenance as being intrinsic to the functioning of data infrastructures and crucial sites of governance. We show how the SIS II is kept under continuous control to operate as a controlling data infrastructure. This article contributes to a critical inquiry into the datafication of border controls by interrogating how data acquire the status of allegedly credible and accurate information.

They materialize as unruly, unstable and failing infrastructures that are governed through maintenance in order to correct any identified functional anomalies and address potential future failures by adapting them to emerging technologies and the service needs of end-users (e.g. border guards, police). To conceptualize the maintenance labour through which information systems are governed, I synthesize ideas developed in Michel Foucault’s work on biopolitics and governmentality with contributions that explore the agentic forces and proclivities of technoscientific matter. By unearthing the very mechanics of maintenance processes, I make two contributions to the literature that interrogates the digitization and smartening of border security. First, I demonstrate that attending to maintenance permits a more complete understanding of the agency of information systems. Second, I broaden the research agenda that explores border security as practice by directing attention towards the often invisible, but politically significant, labour of maintainers who, by rendering information systems functional, sustain the power to govern international mobility by digital means. © The Author(s) 2020.","Border security; information systems; maintenance; Michel Foucault; New Materialisms",,"Glouftsios, G.; University of TrentoItaly; email: georgios.glouftsios@unitn.it",,"SAGE Publications Ltd",09670106,,SDIAE,,"English","Secur.

This method of data visualisation unearths the deep patterns of opposition that run across the sociotechnical universe where European borders are designed and created. We identify three rationalities of power at play: territorial surveillance aimed at detecting rare events in remote areas, policing of dense human flows by sorting out the benign from the dangerous, and finally global dataveillance of cargo on the move. Instead of trends towards either the hardening of borders or their virtualisation, we, therefore, find multiple rationalities of power simultaneously redefining the modalities of control at EU borders. A second finding shows where precisely critical actors are located in this sociotechnical universe and indicates that the structure of European R&D in border security keeps irregularised migrants off their radars.

The author follows the construction of the FTF as a serious security threat to the European Union’s strategies and action plans, and demonstrates the EU’s practical actions to respond the threat: criminalization of “suspicious travel”, strengthening border security, preliminary screening of asylum seekers at the border. The article pays special attention to the EU plans to achieve compatibility of the European Union information systems, while emphasizing new opportunities for the law enforcement bodies to access migration databases for combating terrorism. Exploring the new EU integration plan for migrants, the author notes that this is for the first time that the European Commission focuses its efforts not only on migrants, but also on the EU citizens with “migratory background”, which is undoubtedly dictated by a fear of the extremist ideology influence on young people. The article exposes certain similarities between the Commission’s methods to coordinate integration and inclusion of migrants, reintegration of the FTF and their families, which indicates that the migration policy is becoming a part of the EU security policy. That leads to a conclusion that securitization of migration policy aims not only and not so much at preventing the potential threat of the returnees’ terrorist activities, but at curbing migration flows as a whole and reducing the number of asylum seekers, in particular. Nevertheless, terrorism and migration seem to be closely linked in public discourse, despite the absence of an empirical basis to conclude that these factors directly influence each other. The author considers the most difficult problem of modern migration policy to be the definition of the red line beyond which its securitization can be justified. © 2021 Olga Yu.

Therefore, this paper analyzes the making of a sociotechnical imaginary of digital transformation of the EU border regime, specifically focusing on the role of eu-LISA, the European agency for the development and management of large-scale IT systems. Drawing on ethnographic observations and interview material, we analyze the ways in which this agency emerges as a site for assembling and rehearsing this sociotechnical imaginary, gradually transforming borders into sites of experimentation in the EU Schengen laboratory. As our case illustrates, studying the visionary dimensions of digital infrastructuring helps us to understand how imagination becomes collectivized and materialized, opens up or closes down sociotechnical realizations, and thus tacitly governs the project of digitally infrastructuring the EU border regime. © The Author(s) 2021.","digitalization; experimental politics; governing migration; infrastructuring borders; sociotechnical imaginary",,"Trauttmansdorff, P.; Department of Science and Technology Studies, Austria; email: paul.trauttmansdorff@univie.ac.at",,"SAGE Publications Inc.",01622439,,,,"English","Sci.

It is also, more discretely, a criminal justice instrument. In addition to the administrative function of ETIAS, there is a law-enforcement capability: once data pertaining to candidates seeking travel authorization is collected, it becomes available to ends which are estranged from the administrative function of ETIAS.

Illustrated through an encounter between a migrant and the Visa Information System (VIS)–one of the largest migration-related biometric databases worldwide–the article’s first part outlines three implications of digitisation. We argue that the VIS assembles a set of previously unconnected state authorities into a group of end users who enact border security and migration management through the gathering, processing and sharing of data; facilitates the practice of traceability, understood as a rationality of mobility control; and has restrictive effects on migrants’ capacity to manoeuvre and resist control. Given these implications, the article’s second part introduces three analytical sensitivities that help to avoid some analytical traps when studying digitisation processes. These sensitivities take their cue from insights and concepts in science and technology studies (STS), specifically material semiotics/ANT approaches. They concern, firstly, the ways that data-based security practices perform the identities of the individuals that they target; secondly, the need to consider possible practices of subversion by migrants to avoid control-biased analyses; and finally, the challenge to study the design and development of border security technologies without falling into either technological or socio-political determinism. © 2020 The Author(s).

While the policing of mobilities is increasingly discussed in terms of instantaneity, speed, and real-timeness, little has been said about the temporalities of data mobility. This paper focuses on the socio-technical architectures that are generative of data mobilities and analyses the temporality of data circulation as the outcome of a contingent formation of various actors, sites, and materials. Based on an indepth analysis of the Frontex information system Joint Operation Reporting Application (JORA), it works out several sources of turbulence that turn data mobility into a ‘crooked’ process of patching multiple temporalities and paces together. It will show how the implementation of JORA faces data frictions, issues of data quality, the synchronization of multiple orderings, and the clash of temporalities of border control practices on the ground. Thus, the infrastructuring of data circulation has effects on interorganizational forms of collaboration and knowledge production as well as on border work in the field of European migration and border control. © 2020 The Author(s).

Data behaviourism establishes a new way of seeing conduct, adding a potential future layer to it. Taming future mobilities through data-mining and future-oriented algorithmic processing, ETIAS imagines mobile subjects in terms of their motility and thereby produces dividuals and blurs the spatio-temporal boundedness of the EU border.

Alterity processing refers to the data infrastructures, knowledge practices, and bureaucratic procedures through which populations unknown to European actors are translated into “European-legible” identities. By drawing on fieldwork conducted in Italy and the Hellenic Republic from 2017 to 2018, this article argues that different registration and identification procedures compete to legitimize different chains of actors, data, and metadata as more authoritative than others. Competing procedures have governance implications, as well, with some actors being included and others being excluded. Furthermore, there is evidence that—despite procedural rigidities—applicants themselves propose alternative chains of actors, data, and metadata that are more meaningful to them. In this tension, it is not only the individual Other that is enacted but also specific bureaucratic orders cutting across old and new European actors and distinctive understandings of “Europe.” From a technology studies perspective, this article engages in a dialogue with the emergent debate on Hotspots, the scholarship about the infrastructural construction of Europe and political sociology. © The Author(s) 2019.","bureaucracy; data infrastructures; Europe; metadata; migration; population",,"Pelizza, A.; Science, Netherlands; email: apelizza@processingcitizenship.eu",,"SAGE Publications Inc.",01622439,,,,"English","Sci.

They are the most advanced form of information exchange, conferring direct information access to competent authorities. Interoperable information systems are intended for the exchange of raw material for investigation purposes, which at a later stage could become evidence at trial. Interoperable information systems challenge existing cooperation dynamics and redefine the role of the actors involved. It is questionable whether mutual recognition and approximation, which have been considered the cornerstone of judicial cooperation in both civil and criminal matters for many years, can describe alone integration dynamics in law enforcement cooperation, particularly with reference to information sharing. This article appraises whether, and to what extent, law enforcement access to and use of interoperable information systems constitute new modes of law enforcement cooperation in the EU AFSJ. It then assesses what would be the implications of such a paradigm shift on information management. After a short overview of the main features of interoperability, it addresses whether and how the establishment and functioning of interoperable information systems actually or potentially redefines the existing distribution of tasks between th EU and Member States and among competent authorities of different kinds. © 2020 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands","approximation; Area of Freedom Security and Justice; European Union; information management; interoperability; law enforcement; mutual recognition; platform integration; principle of availability",,"GALLI, F.; Research Associate, Italy; email: francesca.galli@eui.eu.",,"Kluwer Law International",13543725,,,,"English","European Public Law",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099545095

At the same time, the way in which the ongoing interoperability initiatives regarding the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ) databases may influence Europol’s international cooperation raises arguably a set of new legal and practical questions that require urgent consideration. This article examines these issues by connecting the Europol-specific legal framework and international practice to the recently adopted AFSJ interoperability regulations as well as to the EU broader data protection framework. It looks more specifically at the balance between data protection/fundamental rights and operational effectiveness throughout Europol’s legal framework and practice of international cooperation and examines the implications of interoperability of AFSJ databases on this. On the one hand, interoperability of AFSJ databases is likely to boost Europol as an information hub through extended personal data collection and data processing possibilities, thereby making the Agency more attractive to international partners. On the other hand, the possibility to transfer such data outside the EU requires strong and effective safeguards from a data protection perspective. The article tentatively concludes that Europol’s current legal and practical framework for international cooperation seems to tilt the balance on the side of operational effectiveness to the detriment of data protection and fundamental rights, and that the new possibilities offered by the interoperability of AFSJ databases will further enhance this trend. © 2020 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands","AFSJ databases; data protection; effective police cooperation; Europol; fundamental rights; international cooperation; interoperability",,"Coman-Kund, F.; Erasmus School of Law, Netherlands; email: comankund@law.eur.nl",,"Kluwer Law International",13543725,,,,"English","European Public Law",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099531525

The entry ban entails that a non-citizen expelled from one member state is barred from returning to the whole Schengen area for up to five years, or longer in case of a threat to public policy or national security. The pan-European validity of the entry ban is ensured by an alert entered in the Schengen Information System (SIS).

In this article, we critically evaluate that claim by developing a notion of deliberation along Habermasian lines, in which deliberation is understood as a process that induces negotiating partners to change positions through argumentation. Based on this conceptualization, we explore to what extent and under which conditions deliberation is likely to occur in intergovernmental settings. To that end, we analyse decision-making on the proposal to give law enforcement authorities access to the Visa Information System. We conclude that a ‘thicker’ conceptualization yields relatively few instances of deliberation. Moreover, we identify a number of specific conditions, and interrelationships between them, that are conducive to this kind of deliberation. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Constructivism; deliberation; European Union; Intergovernmentalism; Justice and Home Affairs (JHA); Visa Information System (VIS)",,"Lo Bianco, S.; Research Group Changing Role of Europe, Netherlands; email: s.lobianco@hhs.nl",,"Routledge",07036337,,,,"English","J.

It locates, contains, and sorts individuals locally at the external borders of the EU and creates, inserts, and processes data for controlling people on the move. Based on ethnographic fieldwork in Greece, including interviews with local administrators from the Registration and Identification Service, Médecins du Monde, Frontex and Hellenic Police and a collection of internal and publicly available planning, policy, and management documents and handbooks, the paper scrutinizes how both the movement of migrants and data is organized at the site. By developing an analytic lens of logistics, it outlines a specific mode of infrastructuring which aligns staff from different organizations with databases, devices, and migrants all in one place and organizes mundane practices such as filling out forms, taking fingerprints, signing, and entering datasets along a chain. That way the hotspot is able to locate, sort, and detain those who arrive at the hardened EU border and to create a data infrastructure for controlling, monitoring, and governing further movement by processing data through the bureaucratic channels of the EU’s transnational control assemblages. © The Author(s) 2019.","Actor-Network Theory; border; control; data; infrastructure; logistics; migration","actor network theory; border region; bureaucracy; European Union; infrastructure planning; migration; territorial management; Greece; Moria","Pollozek, S.; Technical University of MunichGermany; email: silvan.pollozek@tum.de",,"SAGE Publications Ltd",02637758,,,,"English","Environ.

The authors reveal the issues of using the Internet as a tool of the loyal border management of the united countries, ensuring the liberalization of the movement of factors of production through the creation of a single space of freedom, security and justice. The infocommunication technologies are researched as a management mechanism with regard to their influence on modern geopolitical, economic, and specifically industrial processes. The indicated approach is implemented simultaneously both as the management of the content of political relations and the management of their form. The Schengen border management information system is regarded as one of the most striking examples of the information technologies use in the political, economic, and specifically industrial sphere. The structure and legal mechanisms of this system operation are analyzed, on the basis of which the advantages and disadvantages of technological and legal nature are revealed. Special attention is paid to the analysis of the draft laws under development aimed at the improvement of the Schengen information system as an electronic technology for the automated border management of the pan-European space of freedom, security and justice. Among other things the authors have taken into account the latest changes in the legal regulation of the Schengen information system, which took place in October 2018.Taking into account the identified shortcomings in the functioning of the Schengen information system, the recommendations for their elimination are formulated. It is concluded that it is necessary to create a single European information portal in order to optimize the processing of data received from the different agencies. The general trends of the SIS II reform are the simplification and acceleration of the procedures, as well as the strengthening of the personal data protection. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Industrial economics; Information use; Security of data; Business management; Electronic technologies; Factors of production; Industrial processs; Information and Communication Technologies; Information portals; Management mechanisms; Security and justices; Information management",,"Shamne N.L.Malushko E.Y.","Institute of Physics Publishing",17578981,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

A pillar of the IMP is the common environment of Integrated Maritime Surveillance, to improve the exchange of information among the national authorities of the operational sectors involved (transport, environmental protection, fisheries control, border control, application of the general law, customs and defense). CISE (Common Information Sharing Environment) is therefore a fundamental pillar of the European Integrated Maritime Policy and an element of the Action Plan of the European Maritime Security Strategy. CISE represents the collaborative environment on a voluntary basis among the Member States of the European Union, to achieve ""a more interoperable surveillance system to bring together existing monitoring and tracking systems used for maritime safety and security, protection of the marine environment, fisheries control, control of external borders and other law enforcement activities"". CISE implements a decentralized European environment of informative cooperation among all user communities, both civilian and military, at cross-sectoral and cross-border level, including EU agencies, developing an interoperable and information-sharing network powered by information flows coming from National and European information systems in force.

Drawing from the tension between the EU’s attempt to achieve watertight border controls by means of biometric technologies, and migrants’ persistence to move to and live in the EU, the volume pursues two interrelated objectives: first, it studies the encounters between migrants and the Visa Information System (VIS), one of the largest biometric databases in the world, from the perspective of mobility in order to investigate how migrants appropriate mobility via Schengen visa within and against this biometric border regime. Second, it addresses criticisms of autonomy of migration in order to develop it as a viable approach for border, migration and critical security studies. Hence, the book is driven by two interrelated research questions: what does the assertion of moments of autonomy of migration refer to in the context of border regimes that use biometrics to turn migrants’ bodies into a means of mobility control? And how do migrants appropriate mobility via Schengen visa within and against biometric border regimes? This book will be of great interest to scholars in border, migration and critical security studies, as well as researchers engaged in citizenship studies, surveillance studies, political theory, critical IR theory and international political sociology. © 2019 Stephan Scheel.",,,"Scheel, S.; Sociology department, Germany",,"Taylor and Francis",,9781351977838; 9781138285361,,,"English","Autonomy of Migration?: Appropriating Mobil. within Biometric Bord.

At the same time, the author focuses on studying the legal framework, as well as the key elements of this policy. Author believes that the system of EU legal acts regulating visa relations should be qualified as EU visa legislation, which is one of the elements of a larger system of legal acts in the field of freedom of movement of persons. The EU visa policy has two key areas: the establishment of a visa / visa-free entry regime; the establishment of the procedure and conditions for issuing short stay visas. The latter area also includes issues related to the functioning of the Visa Information System. Currently, the EU realizes the reform of the visa policy, which covers both its directions. The analysis of the ongoing reform shows that the EU, on the one hand, seeks to strengthen external borders by creating additional control mechanisms, and. on the other hand, as a compensatory measure, creates more comfortable conditions for the entry of frequent and law-abiding travelers. © 2018 Institute of Europe Russian Academy of Sciences.

The analysis comes in a situation, where there are multiple regulations, directives, guidelines; but it lacks a unified standard for the implementation of the member states subsystems. The main finding is that a separate standard is not necessary; however, there is a need for setting minimum requirements, ensuring security of the information systems, that come with appropriate guidelines that help the member states to achieve the minimum requirements. The second finding is that there is a need for greater cooperation and an increased knowledge exchange of the methods used in the member states.

One critical application domain for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) streaming is border security, mapping and precise agriculture. Regarding the first issue, the current political evolutions in the wide region of south eastern European territory reveals the significance for a wide surveillance. This is also valid in agriculture to get a more precise and high quality production. However, efficient access to video data located on Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAVs) and real-time streaming is an arduous task due to large bandwidth requirements imposed by the video sequences and the unstable capacity and bandwidth of the wireless channel. In addition, the traditional representation of a video sequence as a stream of consecutive frames is not reliable for new emerging applications needed in aerial vehicles such as content indexing, retrieval and non-linear access and browsing. This reveals the need for the implementation of non-linear tools enabling the efficient summarization of the visual content. Summarization refers to the process of creating compact summaries of the Audio-Video (AV) content that facilitate discovery, browsing and navigation of the AV content. In this paper, we propose a fast video summarization algorithm that enables the extraction of key frames from UAV-captured videos. The algorithm exploits the curvature of the magnitude of visual feature trajectory to detect content fluctuations both in time and in space. Experiments on real-life aerial data reveal the efficiency of the proposed schemes. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Box 90153, Tilburg, 5000 LE, Netherlands","Record numbers of migrants and refugees fleeing violence and poverty in parts of Africa and the Middle East present the European Union with unprecedented challenges, including in determining their identity as well as status. In recent years problems of identifying immigrants have been addressed in order to fight identity fraud and illegal entry of migrants. As a result, a wide variety of digital systems have been introduced to orchestrate an effective, preventative modus of identification of migrants. Digital systems are in particular geared towards spotting those migrants who (are about to) commit identity fraud or who enter the territory of EU member states illegally. Although the key aim of the digital systems is framed to protect the administrative, geographic and legal borders of the member state and the safety of its population, empirically based studies demonstrate that these systems bring new risks for migrants themselves. This article intends to contribute to the discussion on the use of digital systems for managing the movement of migrants by analysing identification and risk assessment systems from the perspective of the new European data protection regime and the European Convention on Human Rights. For this purpose, two identification systems - the so-called INS console within the Dutch immigration and border sector, and the PROGIS console within the law enforcement sector - are analysed. A third is the Advanced Passenger Information system operated at Schiphol Airport by border control and immigration services. Against the background of the position of many migrants finding themselves at risk in their home country and of the two legislative frameworks mentioned above, this article addresses two issues. First, the analysis focuses on how migrants are perceived by digital monitoring practices: are they themselves at risk, non-risk or do they pose a risk? In the EU, migrants must prove that their case is worthy of asylum status because they are 'at risk' from political unrest or other life-threatening circumstances in their home country. Yet, empirical data gathered through semi-structured interviews show that simply abiding by the standards during an enrolment process of the INS console, rather than being 'at risk', a migrant can easily be categorised as 'posing a risk' (La Fors-Owczynik & Van der Ploeg, 2015). Second, this article aims to investigate what the capacity of the new data protection regime is in protecting migrants from being framed as 'a risk' or a 'misfit' stemming from the use of digital systems. Given this second aim, the following discussion also intends to explore the extent to which the European Convention on Human Rights can provide an additional legal remedy for migrants being digitally categorised in a manner that is detrimental to them. © 2016 Karolina La Fors-Owczynik.","Biometrics; Border control; Data protection; Human rights; Identification; Immigration; Law enforcement; Migrants; Profiling; Risk","Air navigation; Biometrics; Crime; Data privacy; Identification (control systems); Law enforcement; Laws and legislation; Risks; Social aspects; Border control; Human rights; Immigration; Migrants; Profiling; Risk assessment","La Fors-Owczynik, K.; Tilburg Institute for Law, P.O.

To do so, the paper analyses relevant documents referring to SIS, VIS and EURODAC. These systems have assumed the traditional border function of deciding on societal inclusion and exclusion.

Changes in EU policies are not only the consequences of ‘grand moments’ of treaty and institutional changes. In order to identify and explain changes in everyday decision-making, one should complement the traditional strategic bargaining perspective on decision-making with a constructivist view on discourse or language as sources of change. With the insights of both constructivists and communication theorists, this study focuses on the identification of conditions and occurrences of deliberation in the daily running of decision-making in the EU that allow for changes facilitating the adoption of new policy instruments. In this light a study of two cases will be presented of which each has taken place in a different institutional setting.

The findings of this analysis will be compared to findings of another analysis.

Interest in border studies has increased with recent changes in geographical locations of the border or the fluctuation of the permeability of the border between some countries, such as in the European Union. Whether the nations are trying to increase traffic flow of the border or to implement stricter border control, having appropriate information of the border is crucial for effective policymaking. The objective of this research was to identify areas of high porosity, or high permeability, for pedestrians along the southern national border region in Carinthia, Austria using terrain, land use, and road data along with geocomputational methods. Two unsupervised classification methods, the fuzzy K-means clustering and the Self-Organizing Map, were applied to segment the border into homogeneous zones according to topographic and infrastructural attributes. The fuzzy Kmeans clustering method was chosen for its ability to allow for a continuous approach to classification. With this method, an object can belong, with different degrees of membership, to multiple classes, which is a more realistic reflection of the natural world than discrete clustering, where each object can only belong to one class. However, the fuzzy K-means clustering method does have disadvantages, i.e. the user must determine the number of classes and the input parameters are required to be in continuous format. The second classification method, the Self-Organizing Map, is a type of artificial neural network and was chosen for its ability to automatically determine the number of classes and handle categorical data. The Self-Organizing Map is unique because it can transform high dimensional data into low dimensional display while preserving the topology and spatial distribution of the input parameters. The results of the two classification methods suggest that the fuzzy K-means classification is more effective than the Self-Organizing Map for this situation. However, more research is needed to determine the fit of these algorithms for particular spatial data classification tasks. The results obtained from this research provide an insight into the permeability of the border region of Carinthia, Slovenia, and Italy to pedestrian traffic and can be potentially useful for decision making processes for tourism development and road transportation management in that region. Furthermore, the approach presented in this article can be applied to other national borders to identify zones permeable to pedestrian traffic. © 2013 Cartography and Geographic Information Society.","Border studies; GIS; Spatial clustering; Spatial decision support; Visual analytics","Border studies; Classification methods; Decision making process; Geographical locations; Spatial clustering; Spatial Decision Support; Unsupervised classification; Visual analytics; Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Conformal mapping; Decision making; Decision support systems; Geographic information systems; Neural networks; Research; Research and development management; Data mining; algorithm; artificial neural network; border region; classification; comparative study; decision making; fuzzy mathematics; GIS; land use; pedestrian; policy making; road transport; terrain; territorial management; tourism development; transportation planning; Austria; Carinthia; Italy; Slovenia","Hisakawa, N.; Department of Geography, United States; email: nghisakawa@gmail.com",,,15230406,,CGSCF,,"English","Cartogr.

As its name suggests, the concept of autonomy of migration's core thesis proposes that migratory movements yield moments of autonomy in regards to any attempt to control and regulate them. Yet, the concept of autonomy of migration has been repeatedly accused of being based on and contributing to a romanticisation of migration. After outlining two advantages the concept of autonomy of migration offers for the analysis of biometric border regimes, I demonstrate that processes of biometric rebordering increase the warranty of the two allegations, which feed this major critique. Drawing on examples relating to the Visa Information System, I show that processes of biometric rebordering alter the practical terms and material conditions for moments of autonomy of migration to such an extent that it becomes necessary to rethink not only some of the concept of autonomy of migration's central features, but the notion of autonomy itself. In the final section, I therefore point out some directions to develop the concept of autonomy of migration as an approach, which is better equipped to investigate today's struggles of migration without being prone to the critique of implicating a romanticisation of migration. © The Author(s) 2013.","Autonomy of migration; biometric rebordering; securitisation; security dispositif; situated knowledge",,"Scheel, S.; Department of Political and International Studies (POLIS), Walton Hall, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, United Kingdom; email: stephan.scheel@open.ac.uk",,,03058298,,,,"English","Millennium J.

The current retrofitting and technological remediation of borders suggests their transformation away from static demarcators of hard territorial boundaries toward much more sophisticated, flexible, and mobile devices of tracking, filtration, and exclusion. Borders require the labor of software developers, designers, engineers, infrastructure builders, border guards, systems experts, and many others who produce the ""smart border""; but they also depend on the labor of ""data-ready"" travelers who produce themselves at the border, as well as the underground labor of those who traffic in informal and illegalized economies across such borders. Bordering increasingly relies on technological forms of mediation that are embedded within hi-tech, military and private corporate logics, but are also resisted by electronic and physical ""hacks"" or bypassing of informational and infrastructural architectures. In this paper we consider three socio-technological assemblages of the border, and the labor which makes and unmakes them: (1) the interlocking ""cyber-mobilities"" of contemporary airports including visual technologies for baggage, cargo, and passenger inspection, as well as information technologies for passenger dataveillance, air traffic control, and human resource systems; (2) the development of the Schengen Information System database of the EU, and its implications for wider migrant rights and internal mobility within the EU, as well as radical border media that have attempted to intervene in that border space; and (3) elements of the US-Mexico ""smart border"" regime known as the Secure Border Initiative Network (2006-2011), and those who have tried to tactically evade, disrupt, or undermine the working of this border. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","bio-informatics; mobility; security; smart border; tactical media",,"Vukov, T.; Department of Communication, , Quebec, Canada; email: tamara.vukov@umontreal.ca",,,10350330,,,,"English","Soc.

This can be achieved only by a close collaboration between information systems of public administration bodies in mutual relations and in relations with natural persons and businesses. The prerequisite is achieving the interoperability between the systems. Interoperable, basic infrastructural services (secure communication between administration bodies, cross-border access to files), common specifications, guidelines for interoperability and reusable software are the basic factors in an effective electronic administration. Works are underway to adopt an updated version of European interoperability framework, support and popularize interoperable services of electronic administration, based on standards, open specifications and interfaces. The paper presents the conception of interoperability and standardization of ubiquitous systems e-Government in the European Union member states. It defines the term ""interoperability"".

The number of border management tools has substantially expanded and includes simple fences and more sophisticated optical and electro-optical sensors, information technology (IT) intrusion detection systems, biometrical and patterns sensors and systems, manned and unmanned aircrafts, as well as intelligent surveillance means. Altogether, the border management security market amounts to C22 billion in the US and C10 billion in Europe. In addition, a multitude of ‘stakeholders’ has largely expanded to include not only traditional border management actors (e.g. the DG Justice and the DG Home Affairs in the European Commission, Interpol, Europol or the Customs Cooperation Working Party), but also the European Union AntiFraud Office (OLAF), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) programme, the Joint Research Centre (JRC), the European Union Satellite Centre (EUSC), the European Defence Agency (EDA) or the European Security Research and Innovation Forum (ESRIF). Operational cooperation on border management is mostly structured around the activities of the European Patrol Network and the External Borders Agency Frontex (joint operations, Focal Points, Rapid Border Intervention Teams, risk analysis, training, technical assistance to Member States), which is the focus of the next chapter. The implementation of these measures is supported through the use of burden-sharing tools like the Schengen Facility (e.g. C400 million for Romania and Bulgaria in 2007-2009) and the External Border Fund, which amounts to C1.82 billion for the period 2007-2013, the major part of which is distributed among Member States depending on their burden regarding external border controls and visa policy. Several new legislative proposals are in the making concerning, among others, the amendment of the Schengen Borders Code, setting up an Entry Exit System (EES) and a Registered Traveller Programme (RTP), as well as the start of operations of the Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ). These developments give rise to an intricate system for the defence of the EU’s realm where the construction of the border depends on its dislocation, both political and spatial. The three clusters of border policy repertoires described in this chapter, surveillance, smart borders and integrated border management, epitomise the emerging practice the EU has engaged in. They reflect the ‘pushing-out of borders’ in two distinctive ways: through technological devices and a particular relationship with the neighbour. The latter relies on attempts to prevent the border-related threat from entering the EU’s realm by shifting increasing responsibility to contain it onto the neighbour. This move is accompanied by conditionality (e.g. the pressure towards readmission tied with the promises of visa facilitation) and the projection of the EU political and social model geared at a systemic reform of the neighbour. A quote from the EU Internal Security Strategy (ISS) reflects the rationale underpinning this logic: ‘The quality of our democracy and public confidence in the Union will depend to a large extent on our ability to guarantee security and stability in Europe and to work with our neighbours and partners to address the root causes of the internal security problems faced by the EU’ (European Council 2010b: 9). Here the externally assisted reform, most explicitly in our case integrated border management and security sector reform, turn into modern state-building.1. © 2012 Selection and editorial material, Christian Kaunert, Sarah Léonard and Patryk Pawlak.",,,,,"Taylor and Francis",,9781136332777; 9780415677943,,,"English","European Homeland Security: A European Strategy in the Mak.?",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123146228

The European Union (EU) has been particularly successful in promoting its approaches internationally despite the potentially negative impact of these technologies on civil liberties and fundamental freedoms.This article investigates why, despite a clear divergence between the EU's declarations and practice in balancing fundamental freedoms and security, the EU has faced little external criticism regarding its extraterritorial instruments. In the case of EU-US relations, the EU managed to optimize the outcome of the Passenger Name Record (PNR) negotiations by using the security-oriented US legislation as a pretext for advancing its own security-dominated agenda. At the same time, the EU managed to avoid criticism from the United States and international civil society regarding its flagship projects like the'border package'or the creation of large-scale IT systems for collecting and processing personal information. In its relations with candidate countries, the EU has managed to escape criticism due to several factors: weak data protection institutions in those countries, different priorities set by the accession process, and rather weak civil society organizations (CSOs) dependent on EU funding. In the absence of external actors challenging the EU approach, recourse to the international judicial bodies is the last resort for taking action in this regard.This article argues that inconsistency and contradiction between the EU's various policy approaches has contributed to the unintentional development of an external governance model that maximizes the EU's position internationally. © 2012 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.",,,"Pawlak, P.; European Union Institute for Security StudiesFrance",,"Kluwer Law International",13846299,,,,"English","Eur.

Finishing of Motorway cross (parts of EU corridors 5 and 10) the country has moved in new era of faster, more accessible road traffic. At the same time many ITS systems were installed and upgraded to ensure smooth and safe traffic flow at the increasing traffic volumes. Several new tunnels were built, most notably Šentvid motorway tunnel, which has highest daily volume of all Slovenian tunnels. New traffic safety systems which were installed are presented in the paper. Open road traffic safety and driver information systems, largest national road ITS project, are also detailed. Advances have been made in the area of road weather sensors with unified information system and in emergency call systems with gradual transition to VoIP architecture. Four regional motorway control centres with full-time staff were established with all necessary infrastructures to monitor traffic situation and react in case of dangerous events by using VMSes or deploying field units. The focus of ITS in Slovenia was therefore on motorways, but there were several successful projects also outside of this scope. The intersection system of city of Ljubljana was increased from 117 to 207 intersections under central system control. Also, with entrance of Slovenia in Schengen area in 2007, the new customs service information system was put into operation featuring cargo vehicle control and tracking at the border crossings. This paper describes these various ITS project and experience learned during their installation and operation. It also provides some ideas for future development and enhancements.","ITS; Traffic management system; Tunnels","Advanced driver assistance systems; Advanced traffic management systems; Control system synthesis; Information systems; Internet telephony; Management information systems; Network architecture; Roads and streets; Safety engineering; Traffic control; Tunnels; Border crossings; Driver information systems; Emergency call systems; Gradual transition; ITS; Motorway tunnels; Traffic management systems; Traffic situations; Highway planning","Zorin, U.; DARS, Ulica XIV.

When Information & Communication Technologies (ICT) are involved, outsourcing becomes rather complex. In such cases, a clear definition of the processes to be implemented and a quality assurance monitoring system are crucial factors for success. In addition, globalization, world level financial instability and the need to adjust to evolving standards and requirements, compel Governments and Public Organizations to become more adaptable and to handle changes efficiently. This last constraint has a direct impact on the design of ICT systems; Business Process Modeling becomes mandatory as the most appropriate change management mechanism. In this paper, a new methodology is presented based on Business Process Modeling. Once the model is completed, the relative program code of the final system is produced. In addition to this system, an end-to-end monitoring platform is developed to continuously search, identify and assess technical and human deficiencies. This goal is achieved by following-up the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the processes, through the creation and management of adequate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Once the technical problems are suitably addressed, the focus moves to human skills and competency.

The twin issues ofdata protection and data security within what was the EU’s third pillar legal framework thereforecome to the fore. With the Lisbon Treaty reform of the EU, and the increased role of the Commissionin PJCCM policy areas, and the integration of the PJCCM provisions with what have traditionallybeen the pillar I activities of Frontex, the opportunity for streamlining the data protection and datasecurity provisions of the law enforcement bodies of the post-Lisbon EU arises. This is recognisedby the Commission in their drafting of an amending regulation for Frontex2, when they say thatthey would prefer “to return to the question of personal data in the context of the overall strategyfor information exchange to be presented later this year and also taking into account the reflectionto be carried out on how to further develop cooperation between agencies in the justice and homeaffairs field as requested by the Stockholm programme.”3 The focus of the literature published onthis topic, has for the most part, been on the data protection provisions in Pillar I, EC. While thefocus of research has recently sifted to the previously Pillar III PJCCM provisions on data protection,4a more focused analysis of the interlocking issues of data protection and data security needs to bemade in the context of the law enforcement bodies, particularly with regard to those which werebased in the pre-Lisbon third pillar. This paper will make a contribution to that debate, arguing thata review of both the data protection and security provision post-Lisbon is required, not only inorder to reinforce individual rights, but also inter-agency operability in combating cross-border EUcrime. The EC’s provisions on data protection, as enshrined by Directive 95/46/EC, do not apply tothe legal frameworks covering developments within the third pillar of the EU. Even CouncilFramework Decision 2008/977/JHA, which is supposed to cover data protection provisions withinPJCCM expressly states that its provisions do not apply to “Europol, Eurojust, the SchengenInformation System (SIS)” or to the Customs Information System (CIS). In addition, the post Treaty ofPrüm provisions covering the sharing of DNA profiles, dactyloscopic data and vehicle registrationdata pursuant to Council Decision 2008/615/JHA, are not to be covered by the provisions of the2008 Framework Decision. As stated by Hijmans and Scirocco, the regime is “best defined as apatchwork of data protection regimes”, with “no legal framework which is stable and unequivocal,like Directive 95/46/EC in the First pillar”.5 Data security issues are also key to the sharing of data in organised crime or counterterrorism situations. This article will critically analyse the current legalframework for data protection and security within the third pillar of the EU. © 2010, Journal of Contemporary European Research.

Increasingly people have little control over their own information and this is the real challenge facing organisations and governments in an era of exponential creation, networking and duplication of data, most of which is identifiable in nature. Traditionally, identity management has been considered as the process of managing information for a person's interaction with an organization's information systems and assets. Nowadays, there is a key fundamental business shift away from the traditional approach in which a user's identity was managed manually on a system-by-system basis. Federated identity management, which supports multiple entities connected within a circle of trust, is one of the major initiatives growing out of Web services that will provide substantial benefits to corporations and consumers. Federated identity management (IDM) refers to the ability to establish trust relationships between various security domains to enable the passing of authentication, authorization and privacy assertions. This is a key aspect of identity management in the context of business-to-business integration, typically when Web services technology is used. The European Union is actively pursuing an interoperable pan-European e-IDM since 2006. Under this initiative, EU governments have agreed to facilitate, as a matter of high priority, the establishment for mutual recognition of national electronic identities for public administration Web sites and services. The key reason for promoting the interoperability of e-identification is the growth of demand for cross-border services, which needs to be met by equivalent crossborder framework of cooperation. Once this initiative reaches a good level of success and an acceptable maturity level, it could possibly prove the model for a worldwide interoperable e-identification system, increasing the efficiency of transactions, and significantly enhancing the effectiveness of border control systems. © 2010 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

This greediness indicates the distorting potential of information technology regarding the means-end logic. Our analysis suggests that the European migration policy is stuck in a 'digital fix', i.e. a technological fix focusing on ICT. We identify three political issues concerning greedy information technology within the context of the European migration policy.

The objective of this ""border monitoring"" assessment is to contribute to the development of scenarios on potential future migration through land borders and to develop recommendations for border management. This study begins with an assessment of statistical and earth observation information datasets to monitor border crossing in real time. Due to the unavailability of relevant data, this study evolved towards an indirect definition of migrants' likelihood to cross the border (the border permeability). The permeability model combines earth observation and geo-spatial technologies with formal decision theory to assess the likelihood that a border area may be crossed by an illegal migrant, based on a presumed cost/opportunity behavioural strategy. Two preliminary permeability models were developed on two different areas, the EU-25 land border and the Central African region. The resulting permeability maps help in the overall understanding of illegal migration patterns. In the border monitoring process, they help to identify high permeability areas where change detection analysis can be carried out using medium resolution satellite imagery. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","geographical information system; Illegal migration; multi-criteria model; remote sensing; statistics",,"Stephenne, N.; Institute for the Protection and Security of the Citizen, Via Fermi 1, 21020 Ispra, (VA), Italy; email: nathalie.stephenne@jrc.it",,"Springer Netherlands",,9781402084836,,,"English","Remote Sens. from Sp.: Support.

It was noted in that Report that the existing problems in judicial and enforcement agencies’ cooperation across the EU made the use of national criminal records as a means of combating organised crime rather problematic. It was pointed out that practical problems hindered the speed, access and effectiveness of existing methods of cooperation and the creation and use of an ECR was the way forward for the effective combating of organised crime. Of course, the idea of using databases as a means of combating crime is not new. Practically all enforcement agencies around the world use ‘files’ (in paper or digital form) on crimes, suspects and methods (modus operandi) in an attempt to prevent crime or prosecute criminals. In fact, in recent years digital databases such as the Schengen Information System (SIS) have become the first line of defence against transnational organised crime and plans to update and develop further the system into a SIS II are on the way. What makes the proposal for an ECR different is the idea of an EU-wide dedicated database which addresses the problem directly: in other words, a dedicated database which contains information extracted from national criminal records on selected crimes. © Cambridge University Press 2008 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",,,"Stefanou, C.; Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, School of Advanced Studies, University of LondonUnited Kingdom",,"Cambridge University Press",,9780511495069; 9780521866699,,,"English","Towards a European Criminal Record",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927004727

Steps in this direction have taken the form of initiatives aiming both at eliminating obstacles to the exchange of personal data between national authorities and at creating EU-wide structures and databases. The emphasis on developing EU-wide databases can be witnessed in both the immigration and asylum field (with the establishment of the EURODAC and Schengen Information System (SIS) databases and proposals to establish a Visa Information System (VIS) in the pipeline) and the criminal law/policing field (the Europol database and part of the SIS database being prime examples). Political reactions to terrorist attacks this decade have led to calls for increasingly linking these databases (notwithstanding their different purpose) and increasing their ‘interoperability’ – a strategy clearly visible in the 2004 Hague Programme, a five-year renewal of the EU Justice and Home Affairs strategy.

Specifically, I examine the expanding scope and implications of biometric surveillance technologies in liberal states’ border securitization practices. Since 9/11, biometric identification systems have been fast‐tracked as a “silver‐bullet solution” to address perceived threats to border security in the United States and the European Union. I argue that the deployment of new information and biometric technologies in the United States and the European Union is both individuating and expanding state space into new geographies (i.e., state control is extensifying inside bodies and reaching outside sovereign territorial boundaries). This is due, in part, to the deployment and growing interoperability of new border securitization technologies, like US‐VISIT in the United States and the second generation of the Schengen Information System (SIS II) and Visa Information System (VIS) in the European Union. Biometric systems augment efforts to create a high‐concept, multi‐layered, interoperable system of “virtual borders” designed to deter or intercept determined terrorists, criminals, and unauthorized migrants. As the deployment of biometric technologies creep from the margins to the mainstream, privacy and surveillance concerns will become evermore salient. Equally important are the implications of this incremental “disembodied integration” of people with states on how liberal bionetwork societies make decisions about belonging and exclusion.

Because borders and immigration policy alone cannot stop irregular migration, many governments turn to internal migration control on settled irregular migrants. Surveillance of this group is aimed at their exclusion from key societal institutions, discouraging their stay and ultimately, the deportation of apprehended irregular migrants. These are policies in which identification of irregular migrants is crucial. In this age, registration and identification mean computerized and networked databases. The member states of the EU are currently developing a network of databases in the field of (irregular) immigration. The Schengen Information System (II), the Eurodac database and the Visa Information System are vast databases, often including biometric data, aimed at controlling migration flows and identifying and sorting legal and irregular migrants. These systems are able to 're-identify' parts of the population of irregular migrants on the basis of digital traces of their migration history. It is argued that the digital infrastructure that is now growing past its infancy is developing into a formidable tool for the surveillance of irregular migrants in Europe. ©International Sociological Association.","Databases; European Union; Irregular migration; Social sorting; Surveillance",,"Broeders, D.; Erasmus University of Rotterdam, Netherlands; email: broeders@fsw.eur.nl",,,02685809,,,,"English","Int.

Thus the information management as such becomes a very complex and costly issue. This paper presents an overview of the ORCHESTRA project. ORCHESTRA responds to European needs to develop a standardised, general purpose and generic information infrastructure for the management of environmental and risk management information and related cross-boundary business processes. ORCHESTRA was started in September 2004 and is funded under the 6th framework program of the EU (FP6), under the priority ""Improving Risk Management"" of the Information Society Technologies (IST) program. ORCHESTRA is a 14 million Euro project with 14 partners across Europe. ORCHESTRA is currently developing a general purpose concept for the integration of risk management information systems in Europe. With this, ORCHESTRA contributes to both the INSPIRE and GMES activities in Europe. The paper presents an overview of the project, introduces general problems in integrating crossboundary systems and gives an overview of the appraoch taken by ORCHESTRA. Part of this is the ORCHESTRA Reference Model, which will be the basis for all specification and implementation work undertaken. Note that this paper presents early results.

The right to move freely represents one of the fundamental freedoms of the internal market as well as an essential political element of the package of rights linked to the very status of EU citizenship. The scope ratione personae and the current state of the principle of free movement of persons is assessed by looking at the most recent case law of the Court of Justice and the recently adopted Directive on the rights of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States. But what are the hidden and visible obstacles to free movement of persons in Europe? How can these barriers be overcome to make free movement and residence rights more inclusive? This article addresses these issues along with the following questions: Who are the beneficiaries of the free movement of persons in an enlarged Europe? What is the impact of the recent legal developments in the freedom of movement dimension, such as the European Court of Justice case law and the new Directive? And to what extent are pro-security policies such as the Schengen Information System II and an enhanced interoperability between European databases fully compatible with the freedom of movement paradigm?. © 2017 Wiley.

It is based upon an analysis of special data records, including surveillance of national and alien suspects, asylum and deportations, 'border repulsion of undesirable persons', etc. provided to the press by the Greek Schengen Bureau. Some comparisons are made with other Schengen counterparts. The analysis illustrates those particular geopolitical and sociopolitical control imperatives that actually affect the efficiency of the Schengen Agreement in Greece. Based also on other documented evidence, I conclude that Schengen's impact is a mixed blessing for Greek and European citizens as regards both their free movement, and also potential violations of their privacy and civil liberties. It is clearly an 'immigration anathema' to build a 'Fortress Europe', especially as regards Third World immigrants' and refugees' rights and life chances in the EU.","Asylum-seekers; Fortress Europe; Greece; Immigrants; Schengen information system","asylum seeker; human rights; immigrant population; immigration policy; Greece","Samatas, M.; Department of Sociology, PO Box 91, Rethymnon Crete 74100, Greece; email: samatas@social.soc.uoc.gr",,,1369183X,,,,"English","J.

The communication and co-operation between these system components is increasingly.crossing organisational, regional and even national borders using open networks including the Internet. Such interoperability must be provided in a secure way. Therefore, the different programmes launched by the European Commission dealing with informatics, telematics and the challenges of the Information Society also concern security-related projects. Value-adding the results of several projects within both the TAP and the ISIS programme of the EC as ISHTAR or TRUSTHEALTH on the one hand and MEDSEC or EUROMED-ETS on the other, a regional pilot in oncology for a secure health network has been developed and implemented. Specifying domains and their security policy, security requirements and solutions depending on the systems architecture and behaviour have been defined. Additionally to firewalls at the domain borders, security services based on cryptographic algorithms must be provided which concern application security and/or communication security according to the general security model specified, also taking into account that most of the attacks to domains are caused by insiders. Domains, policies and policy bridging are discussed under the view of security concepts and the concepts-services-mechanisms-algorithms-data relationships developed. Looking for the specific requirements of secure communications in open networks, communication security services and mechanisms will be presented. In that context, an open communication security solution regarding secure messaging (secure EDI) as well as secure channels (SSL and TLS in WWW environments) has been developed and implemented and will be demonstrated in detail.

But the existence of databases ranging from the relatively unsophisticated Schengen Information System and the proposed European Information System to the UCLAF system to combat fraud raises many legal and criminological issues. There is a danger that the database and profiling approach exaggerates the scale of organised crime to excuse unwarranted interference with civil liberties, and it is not easy to keep large databases secure from hackers. There is no proper mechanism for complaining about abuses, and there may be inadequate protection for political dissidents. On the other hand pooling of information enables the authorities to allocate scarce resources to the most harmful crimes and can help to minimise unwarranted invasions of privacy.
