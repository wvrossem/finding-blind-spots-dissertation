But the existence of databases ranging from the relatively unsophisticated Schengen Information System and the proposed European Information System to the UCLAF system to combat fraud raises many legal and criminological issues. There is a danger that the database and profiling approach exaggerates the scale of organised crime to excuse unwarranted interference with civil liberties, and it is not easy to keep large databases secure from hackers. There is no proper mechanism for complaining about abuses, and there may be inadequate protection for political dissidents. On the other hand pooling of information enables the authorities to allocate scarce resources to the most harmful crimes and can help to minimise unwarranted invasions of privacy. National SIRENE bureaux provide judicial and administrative checks by filtering individual requests for information from databases, and safeguards have been built into the procedures for accessing the IRENE-3 database.

Rather than IT rendering the body irrelevant to identity -a mistaken idea to begin with -the coupling of biometrics with IT unequivocally puts the body center stage. The questions to be raised about biometrics is how bodies will become related to identity, and what the normative and political ramifications of this coupling will be. Unlike the body rendered knowable in the biomedical sciences, biometrics generates a readable body: it transforms the body's surfaces and characteristics into digital codes and ciphers to be 'read' by a machine. ""Your iris is read, in the same way that your voice can be printed, and your fingerprint can be read"", by computers that, in turn, have become ""touch-sensitive"", and endowed with seeing and hearing capacities. Thus transformed into readable ""text"", the meaning and significance of the biometric body will be contingent upon ""context"", and the relations established with other ""texts"". These metaphors open up ways to investigate the different meanings that will become attached to the biometric body and the ways in which it will be tied to identity.

This article will present a critical assessment of the operation of the Convention in light of State practice and case-law in Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom and provide some suggestions towards its improvement. The underpinning of the 'Dublin system' is the principle of authorisation, under which the State which has 'authorised' the entry of an asylum seeker on the territory of the Member State is responsible for examining his or her application. The Convention sets out objective criteria to determine the responsible State in accordance with that principle. Complex procedural rules have also been adopted to implement the Convention, including the draft EURODAC instrument which organises a centralised database of asylum seekers' fingerprints. Yet, various problems have appeared in the operation of the Convention. The scope of the Convention does not include applications for humanitarian protection, the conditions for family reunification are too strictly defined, and most importantly the difficulty of providing strong evidence of illegal entry into one of the Member States renders the Convention useless in many cases. The application of the 'opt-out' clause, which creates a derogation to the criteria determining responsibility, is therefore quite common in humanitarian and family cases, but is also used by the authorities of the Member States to ensure the swift expulsion of asylum seekers. The very basis of the system, the principle of authorisation, should also be re-examined by the Commission which will present a proposal of Community instrument based on the Dublin instrument in the near future.",,,"Hurwitz, A.; BA, Brussels, Belgium",,"Oxford University Press",09538186,,,,"English","Int.

The right to move freely represents one of the fundamental freedoms of the internal market as well as an essential political element of the package of rights linked to the very status of EU citizenship. The scope ratione personae and the current state of the principle of free movement of persons is assessed by looking at the most recent case law of the Court of Justice and the recently adopted Directive on the rights of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States. But what are the hidden and visible obstacles to free movement of persons in Europe? How can these barriers be overcome to make free movement and residence rights more inclusive? This article addresses these issues along with the following questions: Who are the beneficiaries of the free movement of persons in an enlarged Europe? What is the impact of the recent legal developments in the freedom of movement dimension, such as the European Court of Justice case law and the new Directive? And to what extent are pro-security policies such as the Schengen Information System II and an enhanced interoperability between European databases fully compatible with the freedom of movement paradigm?. © 2017 Wiley.

Specifically, I examine the expanding scope and implications of biometric surveillance technologies in liberal states’ border securitization practices. Since 9/11, biometric identification systems have been fast‐tracked as a “silver‐bullet solution” to address perceived threats to border security in the United States and the European Union. I argue that the deployment of new information and biometric technologies in the United States and the European Union is both individuating and expanding state space into new geographies (i.e., state control is extensifying inside bodies and reaching outside sovereign territorial boundaries). This is due, in part, to the deployment and growing interoperability of new border securitization technologies, like US‐VISIT in the United States and the second generation of the Schengen Information System (SIS II) and Visa Information System (VIS) in the European Union. Biometric systems augment efforts to create a high‐concept, multi‐layered, interoperable system of “virtual borders” designed to deter or intercept determined terrorists, criminals, and unauthorized migrants. As the deployment of biometric technologies creep from the margins to the mainstream, privacy and surveillance concerns will become evermore salient. Equally important are the implications of this incremental “disembodied integration” of people with states on how liberal bionetwork societies make decisions about belonging and exclusion. As virtual borders extend into our bodies and around the globe, securitization measures that intersect bodies and states require a virtual theory to account for these new geographies of state space and the qualitative affects on individuals. © 2007, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,"Ross, J.C.; Department of Political Science, , Fort Collins, CO, United States",,,08865655,,,,"English","J.

Because borders and immigration policy alone cannot stop irregular migration, many governments turn to internal migration control on settled irregular migrants. Surveillance of this group is aimed at their exclusion from key societal institutions, discouraging their stay and ultimately, the deportation of apprehended irregular migrants. These are policies in which identification of irregular migrants is crucial. In this age, registration and identification mean computerized and networked databases. The member states of the EU are currently developing a network of databases in the field of (irregular) immigration. The Schengen Information System (II), the Eurodac database and the Visa Information System are vast databases, often including biometric data, aimed at controlling migration flows and identifying and sorting legal and irregular migrants. These systems are able to 're-identify' parts of the population of irregular migrants on the basis of digital traces of their migration history. It is argued that the digital infrastructure that is now growing past its infancy is developing into a formidable tool for the surveillance of irregular migrants in Europe. ©International Sociological Association.","Databases; European Union; Irregular migration; Social sorting; Surveillance",,"Broeders, D.; Erasmus University of Rotterdam, Netherlands; email: broeders@fsw.eur.nl",,,02685809,,,,"English","Int.

This principle of availability was introduced in the Prüm Treaty, also known as Schengen III. The core element of the treaty is the creation of a network of national databases to promote the exchange of information between law enforcement authorities. In particular, reciprocal access is given to Contracting States' national databases, containing DNA profiles, fingerprints and vehicle registration data. Although this initiative started as a multilateral agreement, a small group of influential countries led by Germany has successfully twisted the arms of other EU countries into integrating the provisions of the agreement into the legislative framework of the European Union under the Third Pillar. The treaty has been incorporated into a Council Decision binding on all EU member states. While the treaty represents a progress in the field of cooperation against crime, the implications of this treaty are far reaching. It raises privacy and data protection issues which will affect all EU citizens, primarily due to the absence of common legally binding data protection standards. © 2008 Sylvia Kierkegaard.",,"Database systems; DNA; Electronic data interchange; International cooperation; Security of data; Data protection standards; DNA profiles; Law enforcement","Kierkegaard, S.; International Association of IT LawyersDenmark",,"Elsevier Ltd",02673649,,CLSRE,,"English","Comput Law Secur Rep",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979834489

It was noted in that Report that the existing problems in judicial and enforcement agencies’ cooperation across the EU made the use of national criminal records as a means of combating organised crime rather problematic. It was pointed out that practical problems hindered the speed, access and effectiveness of existing methods of cooperation and the creation and use of an ECR was the way forward for the effective combating of organised crime. Of course, the idea of using databases as a means of combating crime is not new. Practically all enforcement agencies around the world use ‘files’ (in paper or digital form) on crimes, suspects and methods (modus operandi) in an attempt to prevent crime or prosecute criminals. In fact, in recent years digital databases such as the Schengen Information System (SIS) have become the first line of defence against transnational organised crime and plans to update and develop further the system into a SIS II are on the way. What makes the proposal for an ECR different is the idea of an EU-wide dedicated database which addresses the problem directly: in other words, a dedicated database which contains information extracted from national criminal records on selected crimes. © Cambridge University Press 2008 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",,,"Stefanou, C.; Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, School of Advanced Studies, University of LondonUnited Kingdom",,"Cambridge University Press",,9780511495069; 9780521866699,,,"English","Towards a European Criminal Record",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927004727

Steps in this direction have taken the form of initiatives aiming both at eliminating obstacles to the exchange of personal data between national authorities and at creating EU-wide structures and databases. The emphasis on developing EU-wide databases can be witnessed in both the immigration and asylum field (with the establishment of the EURODAC and Schengen Information System (SIS) databases and proposals to establish a Visa Information System (VIS) in the pipeline) and the criminal law/policing field (the Europol database and part of the SIS database being prime examples). Political reactions to terrorist attacks this decade have led to calls for increasingly linking these databases (notwithstanding their different purpose) and increasing their ‘interoperability’ – a strategy clearly visible in the 2004 Hague Programme, a five-year renewal of the EU Justice and Home Affairs strategy. The Hague Programme also calls for the further facilitation of bilateral information exchanges in the police field under the so-called ‘principle of availability’ and for the ‘deepening’ of surveillance by the use of biometrics in the various databases. © Cambridge University Press 2008 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",,,"Mitsilegas, V.; School of Law, Queen Mary, University of LondonUnited Kingdom",,"Cambridge University Press",,9780511495069; 9780521866699,,,"English","Towards a European Criminal Record",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84909422433

This greediness indicates the distorting potential of information technology regarding the means-end logic. Our analysis suggests that the European migration policy is stuck in a 'digital fix', i.e. a technological fix focusing on ICT. We identify three political issues concerning greedy information technology within the context of the European migration policy. The first issue concerns the democratic control on information systems. The second issue discusses the weak legal position of immigrants.

The twin issues ofdata protection and data security within what was the EU’s third pillar legal framework thereforecome to the fore. With the Lisbon Treaty reform of the EU, and the increased role of the Commissionin PJCCM policy areas, and the integration of the PJCCM provisions with what have traditionallybeen the pillar I activities of Frontex, the opportunity for streamlining the data protection and datasecurity provisions of the law enforcement bodies of the post-Lisbon EU arises. This is recognisedby the Commission in their drafting of an amending regulation for Frontex2, when they say thatthey would prefer “to return to the question of personal data in the context of the overall strategyfor information exchange to be presented later this year and also taking into account the reflectionto be carried out on how to further develop cooperation between agencies in the justice and homeaffairs field as requested by the Stockholm programme.”3 The focus of the literature published onthis topic, has for the most part, been on the data protection provisions in Pillar I, EC. While thefocus of research has recently sifted to the previously Pillar III PJCCM provisions on data protection,4a more focused analysis of the interlocking issues of data protection and data security needs to bemade in the context of the law enforcement bodies, particularly with regard to those which werebased in the pre-Lisbon third pillar. This paper will make a contribution to that debate, arguing thata review of both the data protection and security provision post-Lisbon is required, not only inorder to reinforce individual rights, but also inter-agency operability in combating cross-border EUcrime. The EC’s provisions on data protection, as enshrined by Directive 95/46/EC, do not apply tothe legal frameworks covering developments within the third pillar of the EU. Even CouncilFramework Decision 2008/977/JHA, which is supposed to cover data protection provisions withinPJCCM expressly states that its provisions do not apply to “Europol, Eurojust, the SchengenInformation System (SIS)” or to the Customs Information System (CIS). In addition, the post Treaty ofPrüm provisions covering the sharing of DNA profiles, dactyloscopic data and vehicle registrationdata pursuant to Council Decision 2008/615/JHA, are not to be covered by the provisions of the2008 Framework Decision. As stated by Hijmans and Scirocco, the regime is “best defined as apatchwork of data protection regimes”, with “no legal framework which is stable and unequivocal,like Directive 95/46/EC in the First pillar”.5 Data security issues are also key to the sharing of data in organised crime or counterterrorism situations. This article will critically analyse the current legalframework for data protection and security within the third pillar of the EU. © 2010, Journal of Contemporary European Research.

However, despite hundreds of thousands of fingerprints being processed through this system each year, Eurodac has received only very little media attention. In Europe, much of the public debate about the use of biometric technologies for the purpose of automated personal identification is centered on the gradual introduction of new biometric passports. To view biometric systems as "" black boxes "" leads to erroneous conclusions about their effectiveness, both from a technophobic and a technophile point of view. Rather, on a technical, socio-economic and historical level, they should be understood as complex systems that integrate smaller computer systems which are being sold to state and private actors by different manufacturers. The use of biometric identification systems at national borders can be seen as being part of communicative processes in the negotiation of access to resources and power. And the technology itself is a disputatious actor not least because of its unavoidable measurement errors (though categorizable) and unpredictable interactions with human actors. Thus, political responsibility for who is and who is not granted access cannot simply be devolved unto biometric systems as allegedly infallible and unambiguous technical authorities.","Automation of border crossings; Biometric border control; Biometric identification; Biometric identity; Biometrics; Identity check; Identity control; Technology assessment",,"Knaut, A.; Institut für Informatik, Unter den Linden 6, 10099 Berlin, Germany; email: knaut@informatik.hu-berlin.de",,,03411966,,,,"German","Kriminol.

The number of border management tools has substantially expanded and includes simple fences and more sophisticated optical and electro-optical sensors, information technology (IT) intrusion detection systems, biometrical and patterns sensors and systems, manned and unmanned aircrafts, as well as intelligent surveillance means. Altogether, the border management security market amounts to C22 billion in the US and C10 billion in Europe. In addition, a multitude of ‘stakeholders’ has largely expanded to include not only traditional border management actors (e.g. the DG Justice and the DG Home Affairs in the European Commission, Interpol, Europol or the Customs Cooperation Working Party), but also the European Union AntiFraud Office (OLAF), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) programme, the Joint Research Centre (JRC), the European Union Satellite Centre (EUSC), the European Defence Agency (EDA) or the European Security Research and Innovation Forum (ESRIF). Operational cooperation on border management is mostly structured around the activities of the European Patrol Network and the External Borders Agency Frontex (joint operations, Focal Points, Rapid Border Intervention Teams, risk analysis, training, technical assistance to Member States), which is the focus of the next chapter. The implementation of these measures is supported through the use of burden-sharing tools like the Schengen Facility (e.g. C400 million for Romania and Bulgaria in 2007-2009) and the External Border Fund, which amounts to C1.82 billion for the period 2007-2013, the major part of which is distributed among Member States depending on their burden regarding external border controls and visa policy. Several new legislative proposals are in the making concerning, among others, the amendment of the Schengen Borders Code, setting up an Entry Exit System (EES) and a Registered Traveller Programme (RTP), as well as the start of operations of the Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ). These developments give rise to an intricate system for the defence of the EU’s realm where the construction of the border depends on its dislocation, both political and spatial. The three clusters of border policy repertoires described in this chapter, surveillance, smart borders and integrated border management, epitomise the emerging practice the EU has engaged in. They reflect the ‘pushing-out of borders’ in two distinctive ways: through technological devices and a particular relationship with the neighbour. The latter relies on attempts to prevent the border-related threat from entering the EU’s realm by shifting increasing responsibility to contain it onto the neighbour. This move is accompanied by conditionality (e.g. the pressure towards readmission tied with the promises of visa facilitation) and the projection of the EU political and social model geared at a systemic reform of the neighbour. A quote from the EU Internal Security Strategy (ISS) reflects the rationale underpinning this logic: ‘The quality of our democracy and public confidence in the Union will depend to a large extent on our ability to guarantee security and stability in Europe and to work with our neighbours and partners to address the root causes of the internal security problems faced by the EU’ (European Council 2010b: 9). Here the externally assisted reform, most explicitly in our case integrated border management and security sector reform, turn into modern state-building.1. © 2012 Selection and editorial material, Christian Kaunert, Sarah Léonard and Patryk Pawlak.",,,,,"Taylor and Francis",,9781136332777; 9780415677943,,,"English","European Homeland Security: A European Strategy in the Mak.?",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123146228

Finishing of Motorway cross (parts of EU corridors 5 and 10) the country has moved in new era of faster, more accessible road traffic. At the same time many ITS systems were installed and upgraded to ensure smooth and safe traffic flow at the increasing traffic volumes. Several new tunnels were built, most notably Šentvid motorway tunnel, which has highest daily volume of all Slovenian tunnels. New traffic safety systems which were installed are presented in the paper. Open road traffic safety and driver information systems, largest national road ITS project, are also detailed. Advances have been made in the area of road weather sensors with unified information system and in emergency call systems with gradual transition to VoIP architecture. Four regional motorway control centres with full-time staff were established with all necessary infrastructures to monitor traffic situation and react in case of dangerous events by using VMSes or deploying field units. The focus of ITS in Slovenia was therefore on motorways, but there were several successful projects also outside of this scope. The intersection system of city of Ljubljana was increased from 117 to 207 intersections under central system control. Also, with entrance of Slovenia in Schengen area in 2007, the new customs service information system was put into operation featuring cargo vehicle control and tracking at the border crossings. This paper describes these various ITS project and experience learned during their installation and operation. It also provides some ideas for future development and enhancements.","ITS; Traffic management system; Tunnels","Advanced driver assistance systems; Advanced traffic management systems; Control system synthesis; Information systems; Internet telephony; Management information systems; Network architecture; Roads and streets; Safety engineering; Traffic control; Tunnels; Border crossings; Driver information systems; Emergency call systems; Gradual transition; ITS; Motorway tunnels; Traffic management systems; Traffic situations; Highway planning","Zorin, U.; DARS, Ulica XIV.

The regime is defined by a combination of three features: (i) a harmonisation of categories among the EU/Schengen member states, (ii) a growing use of new technology in networked databases and (iii) an increasing sorting of individuals based on security concerns. Although none of these features is new, the combination gives a new impetus to the European border control regime. The article concludes that the Lisbon Treaty and the Stockholm programme consolidate and strengthen existing trends. This implies that policies on border control, asylum, immigration, judicial cooperation and police cooperation are consolidated in a broader approach to border control, and that there is a strengthening of EU foreign policy within the European border control regime. The boundaries between previously dispersed policy areas are blurred. The combination of different aspects of security and various levels of authority requires coordination of policies with substantially different goals, and goes beyond mere border control.","Border control; Databases; Global Approach to Migration; Schengen; Security; Stockholm programme; Treaty of Lisbon",,"Takle, M.; Norwegian Social Research (Nova)Norway",,,1815347X,,,,"English","J.

However, the legislative texts only aim at a minimum harmonization of the member states policies. In fact, instead of a European asylum policy, what has emerged is a policy of non-access to asylum through a number of measures such as making visas compulsory to enter Europe, imposing penalties against carriers, or codifying the notions of ""safe"" countries and ""manifestly unfounded demands"". Rather than introducing a common policy, the Dublin agreements and the Eurodac data base have made it possible to send asylum seekers from country to country. Thus, European asylum policy shows little solidarity and benefits only the ministries of those countries which have elaborated an informal system as early as 1985 in order to stop welcoming asylum seekers. © 2013 Le Seuil.

The current retrofitting and technological remediation of borders suggests their transformation away from static demarcators of hard territorial boundaries toward much more sophisticated, flexible, and mobile devices of tracking, filtration, and exclusion. Borders require the labor of software developers, designers, engineers, infrastructure builders, border guards, systems experts, and many others who produce the ""smart border""; but they also depend on the labor of ""data-ready"" travelers who produce themselves at the border, as well as the underground labor of those who traffic in informal and illegalized economies across such borders. Bordering increasingly relies on technological forms of mediation that are embedded within hi-tech, military and private corporate logics, but are also resisted by electronic and physical ""hacks"" or bypassing of informational and infrastructural architectures. In this paper we consider three socio-technological assemblages of the border, and the labor which makes and unmakes them: (1) the interlocking ""cyber-mobilities"" of contemporary airports including visual technologies for baggage, cargo, and passenger inspection, as well as information technologies for passenger dataveillance, air traffic control, and human resource systems; (2) the development of the Schengen Information System database of the EU, and its implications for wider migrant rights and internal mobility within the EU, as well as radical border media that have attempted to intervene in that border space; and (3) elements of the US-Mexico ""smart border"" regime known as the Secure Border Initiative Network (2006-2011), and those who have tried to tactically evade, disrupt, or undermine the working of this border. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","bio-informatics; mobility; security; smart border; tactical media",,"Vukov, T.; Department of Communication, , Quebec, Canada; email: tamara.vukov@umontreal.ca",,,10350330,,,,"English","Soc.

As its name suggests, the concept of autonomy of migration's core thesis proposes that migratory movements yield moments of autonomy in regards to any attempt to control and regulate them. Yet, the concept of autonomy of migration has been repeatedly accused of being based on and contributing to a romanticisation of migration. After outlining two advantages the concept of autonomy of migration offers for the analysis of biometric border regimes, I demonstrate that processes of biometric rebordering increase the warranty of the two allegations, which feed this major critique. Drawing on examples relating to the Visa Information System, I show that processes of biometric rebordering alter the practical terms and material conditions for moments of autonomy of migration to such an extent that it becomes necessary to rethink not only some of the concept of autonomy of migration's central features, but the notion of autonomy itself. In the final section, I therefore point out some directions to develop the concept of autonomy of migration as an approach, which is better equipped to investigate today's struggles of migration without being prone to the critique of implicating a romanticisation of migration. © The Author(s) 2013.","Autonomy of migration; biometric rebordering; securitisation; security dispositif; situated knowledge",,"Scheel, S.; Department of Political and International Studies (POLIS), Walton Hall, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, United Kingdom; email: stephan.scheel@open.ac.uk",,,03058298,,,,"English","Millennium J.

Current debates on this issue have been largely restricted to a technologically determinist approach that reduces the focus to problems of data misuse and privacy, precluding other pertinent ethical and political concerns. In response, the article engages with Giorgio Agamben's elaborations on the concepts of biopolitics and exception as an alternative way of analysing the use of biometric technology in the governance of forced migrants. It begins with a critical overview of Agamben's conceptualization of biopolitics and the state of exception. It then considers the Eurodac database and the UK's asylum Application Registration Cards as examples to demonstrate how current policies of immigration control and border management are implicated in the logic of exception. It argues that illiberal practices, such as biometric profiling and fingerprinting of asylum seekers and their incarceration in detention centres, are being enforced upon certain groups in ways that render their exclusion from the official juridico-political structure as an 'inclusive exclusion'. Importantly, the function creep of biometrics is not to be understood as the turning of exception into the rule in a somewhat homogenous way, but more as a polysemic process, which involves different forms of discipline and control that are irreducible to one singular paradigm. © The Author 2013.Published by Oxford University Press.All rights reserved.","Agamben; Asylum; Biometrics; Biopolitics; ICTs; Refugees","asylum seeker; biometry; immigration policy; information and communication technology; national identity; political integration; refugee; social exclusion; United Kingdom","Ajana, B.; Department of Culture, United Kingdom; email: btihaj.ajana@kcl.ac.uk",,,09516328,,,,"English","J.

It also induced some third countries, in particular the US, to strive for similar Prüm-like treaties-at times with considerable pressure, as this chapter's case study on the Austrian-US negotiations demonstrates. The chapter argues that the Prüm process reflects both the opportunities and challenges of enhanced cooperation in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. In terms of opportunities, the Prüm process has deepened EU cooperation in an area that was not yet regulated by EU law. Enhancing cooperation in combating serious crime by mutually opening up national databases would not have been possible in the EU framework given that some countries, notably the UK, blocked it. The signing of the Prüm Treaty outside the EU's legal framework has allowed the integration-willing member states to demonstrate the functional benefits of the initiative and to weaken the resistance of the cooperation-reluctant countries. In terms of challenges, however, criticism concerning the Prüm process' legitimacy and acceptability was not silenced, even after the incorporation of the key provisions into EU law. Issues of privacy and data protection were intensively negotiated, in particular in the EU-US cooperation triggered by the Prüm Process. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.

The European Commission has recently proposed a legislative package on “EU Smart Borders” composed of an Entry-Exit System (EES) and the Registered Travellers Programme (RTP). This article examines the ways in which the EU Smart Borders reframe the traditional understandings and configurations of the EU border control system and its migration management toolkit of technologies. It is argued that smart borders take us a step further in the re-framing of mobility and identity controls in the EU Schengen apparatus. EU discourses backing up these measures have not been so much centered on the insecuritization of irregular immigration. They have instead questioned the effectiveness of the existing EU border regime, and used a “de-securitization” and facilitation of the mobility discourse hiding “discrimination by default.” Smart borders aim at identifying the future potential “irregular overstayer” and generalizing the management of mobility and identity of all non-EU travelers by implementing a person-driven approach. This approach transforms the essence of border controls in Europe and reframes the EU travel documents policy by moving away from a nationality-based approach of border controls towards another based on risk and profiling. © 2015 Association for Borderlands Studies.",,,"Carrera, S.; Head of the Justice and Home Affairs Section, Place du Congres 1, Belgium",,"Routledge",08865655,,,,"English","J.

With the insights of both constructivists and communication theorists, this study focuses on the identification of conditions and occurrences of deliberation in the daily running of decision-making in the EU that allow for changes facilitating the adoption of new policy instruments.

An important element of the economic transition was the emerging of cross-border commuting, which became increasingly preferred after accession to the European Union and the Schengen area. Although the extent of cross-border commuting in terms of absolute numbers is negligable in Hungary, the growth trend its significant. The major spatial and demographic characteristics of daily commuting through the Austrian- Hungarian-Slovakian border is presented in a case study based on relevant statistical database. Regarding motivations for commuting across the border it can be stated that at the start economic reasons are the driving force, shifting into social reasons as time passes by. The main motivation behind commuting is the income gap on the labour market of the home and the host country. The dominant direction of commuting abroad is the west, and on a daily or weekly basis most people commute to Austria. Accordingly, municipalities strongly affected by crossborder commuting are concentrated next to the north-western and western border of Hungary. In Hungary, 70% of cross border commuters is male and nearly 60% is younger than 40 years of age. Most of them have secondary education with vocational certificate. They predominantly work in tourism, industry and construction industry.","Average salary; Circular mobility; Commuting; Cross-border commuting; Income gap; Labour market",,"Tamás, E.; MTA CSFK, Hungary; email: egedy@gmx.net",,"Hungarian Central Statistical Office",00187828,,,,"Hungarian","Terul.

The EU visa policy has two key areas: the establishment of a visa / visa-free entry regime; the establishment of the procedure and conditions for issuing short stay visas. The latter area also includes issues related to the functioning of the Visa Information System. Currently, the EU realizes the reform of the visa policy, which covers both its directions. The analysis of the ongoing reform shows that the EU, on the one hand, seeks to strengthen external borders by creating additional control mechanisms, and. on the other hand, as a compensatory measure, creates more comfortable conditions for the entry of frequent and law-abiding travelers. © 2018 Institute of Europe Russian Academy of Sciences.

The story begins in the mid-1980s with the evolution of European integration and the addition of borders to the list of responsibilities shared by the Member States and the EU (then European Community). In parallel, a more limited number of Member States decided to abolish their internal border controls within the framework of the so-called Schengen Agreement and Convention:1 a person allowed to enter the territory of one of the participating countries was automatically permitted to circulate within the Schengen area, without being subjected again to checks at the border. As irregular migrants and criminals were not excluded from free circulation, the dismantlement of internal checks was accompanied by so-called compensatory or flanking measures providing for, among other things, a common set of rules on external borders, short-stay visas and asylum applications.2 With the Treaty of Amsterdam, the law developed under the Schengen Convention, the so-called Schengen acquis, was integrated within EU law.3 At the same time, the EU competence in Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) that had been introduced with the Maastricht Treaty was modified to include the overarching objective of establishing an Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ).4 Since then, a substantial corpus of legislation regulating access to, stay in and removal from the Schengen area has been progressively constructed.5 Efforts to control the movement of non-EU nationals within the Schengen area have been coupled with efforts to prevent them from reaching the EU external border,6 thus necessitating action outside the physical border.7 In all of these developments, the growing tendency to associate non-EU nationals with irregular migration and criminality has been critical. Asylum and visa applications, as well as entry and exit procedures, have been instrumentalised for the purpose of the prevention and investigation of crimes, particularly of terrorism.8 More broadly speaking, security considerations have had a major impact in determining the objectives and rules of immigration control instruments.9. © Francesca Bignami 2020.",,,"Vavoula, N.; Queen Mary, United Kingdom",,"Cambridge University Press",,9781108755641; 9781108485081,,,"English","EU Law in Populist Times: Crises and Prospects",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098295865

Drawing from the tension between the EU’s attempt to achieve watertight border controls by means of biometric technologies, and migrants’ persistence to move to and live in the EU, the volume pursues two interrelated objectives: first, it studies the encounters between migrants and the Visa Information System (VIS), one of the largest biometric databases in the world, from the perspective of mobility in order to investigate how migrants appropriate mobility via Schengen visa within and against this biometric border regime. Second, it addresses criticisms of autonomy of migration in order to develop it as a viable approach for border, migration and critical security studies. Hence, the book is driven by two interrelated research questions: what does the assertion of moments of autonomy of migration refer to in the context of border regimes that use biometrics to turn migrants’ bodies into a means of mobility control? And how do migrants appropriate mobility via Schengen visa within and against biometric border regimes?

Based on this conceptualization, we explore to what extent and under which conditions deliberation is likely to occur in intergovernmental settings. To that end, we analyse decision-making on the proposal to give law enforcement authorities access to the Visa Information System.

If the EU uses its law enforcement and border control tools to the full, exploits the potential of inter-operability between information sources to identify any security concerns from a common pool of information, and uses the stage of entry into the EU as a key point for security checks to take place, the result will negate the ability of terrorist networks to exploit gaps.

Following the 2015 migration crisis, the shortcomings of the EU asylum system became strikingly evident. The subsequent terrorist attacks inaugurated the beginning of a series of revisions to databases used for border control, the registration of asylum seekers and visa applicants, or for alerts regarding criminals. As a final step, the Commission issued two proposals to render all EU databases interoperable in order to provide authorities with better information to tackle identity fraud, prevent irregular migration and mitigate security risks. In May 2019, the Interoperability Regulations were adopted by the co-legislators. Europol and Frontex, two EU Agencies that have been actively engaged in a wide range of operational activities at the external Schengen borders, will be authorized to consult and may subsequently request full access to the interoperable system. This contribution will address some of the concerns that emerge with the connection of originally disconnected databases and seeks to analyse the discrepancies that may arise in the context of interoperability where systematic data exchanges take place between actors that apply different data protection regimes. © 2020 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands","AFSJ; Border Control; Data Protection; Data Quality; EBCGA; EU Databases; Europol; Eurosur; Interoperability; Supervision",,"QUINTEL, T.; University of Luxembourg, Sweden",,"Kluwer Law International",13543725,,,,"English","European Public Law",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099581258

They are the most advanced form of information exchange, conferring direct information access to competent authorities. Interoperable information systems are intended for the exchange of raw material for investigation purposes, which at a later stage could become evidence at trial. Interoperable information systems challenge existing cooperation dynamics and redefine the role of the actors involved. It is questionable whether mutual recognition and approximation, which have been considered the cornerstone of judicial cooperation in both civil and criminal matters for many years, can describe alone integration dynamics in law enforcement cooperation, particularly with reference to information sharing. This article appraises whether, and to what extent, law enforcement access to and use of interoperable information systems constitute new modes of law enforcement cooperation in the EU AFSJ. It then assesses what would be the implications of such a paradigm shift on information management. After a short overview of the main features of interoperability, it addresses whether and how the establishment and functioning of interoperable information systems actually or potentially redefines the existing distribution of tasks between th EU and Member States and among competent authorities of different kinds. © 2020 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands","approximation; Area of Freedom Security and Justice; European Union; information management; interoperability; law enforcement; mutual recognition; platform integration; principle of availability",,"GALLI, F.; Research Associate, Italy; email: francesca.galli@eui.eu.",,"Kluwer Law International",13543725,,,,"English","European Public Law",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099545095

At the same time, the way in which the ongoing interoperability initiatives regarding the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ) databases may influence Europol’s international cooperation raises arguably a set of new legal and practical questions that require urgent consideration. This article examines these issues by connecting the Europol-specific legal framework and international practice to the recently adopted AFSJ interoperability regulations as well as to the EU broader data protection framework. It looks more specifically at the balance between data protection/fundamental rights and operational effectiveness throughout Europol’s legal framework and practice of international cooperation and examines the implications of interoperability of AFSJ databases on this. On the one hand, interoperability of AFSJ databases is likely to boost Europol as an information hub through extended personal data collection and data processing possibilities, thereby making the Agency more attractive to international partners. On the other hand, the possibility to transfer such data outside the EU requires strong and effective safeguards from a data protection perspective. The article tentatively concludes that Europol’s current legal and practical framework for international cooperation seems to tilt the balance on the side of operational effectiveness to the detriment of data protection and fundamental rights, and that the new possibilities offered by the interoperability of AFSJ databases will further enhance this trend. © 2020 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands","AFSJ databases; data protection; effective police cooperation; Europol; fundamental rights; international cooperation; interoperability",,"Coman-Kund, F.; Erasmus School of Law, Netherlands; email: comankund@law.eur.nl",,"Kluwer Law International",13543725,,,,"English","European Public Law",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099531525

The entry ban entails that a non-citizen expelled from one member state is barred from returning to the whole Schengen area for up to five years, or longer in case of a threat to public policy or national security. The pan-European validity of the entry ban is ensured by an alert entered in the Schengen Information System (SIS).

Illustrated through an encounter between a migrant and the Visa Information System (VIS)–one of the largest migration-related biometric databases worldwide–the article’s first part outlines three implications of digitisation. We argue that the VIS assembles a set of previously unconnected state authorities into a group of end users who enact border security and migration management through the gathering, processing and sharing of data; facilitates the practice of traceability, understood as a rationality of mobility control; and has restrictive effects on migrants’ capacity to manoeuvre and resist control. Given these implications, the article’s second part introduces three analytical sensitivities that help to avoid some analytical traps when studying digitisation processes. These sensitivities take their cue from insights and concepts in science and technology studies (STS), specifically material semiotics/ANT approaches. They concern, firstly, the ways that data-based security practices perform the identities of the individuals that they target; secondly, the need to consider possible practices of subversion by migrants to avoid control-biased analyses; and finally, the challenge to study the design and development of border security technologies without falling into either technological or socio-political determinism. © 2020 The Author(s).

With it, six existing EU databases created for security and border management purposes merged into one single, overarching EU information system operating with the purpose of changing the way front-line officers worked in various tasks. The main objective of these Regulations was to prevent and combat illegal immigration and to improve security within the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice of the Union. This article studies the challenges that have emerged from making EU databases and information systems 'interoperable' as well as the potential negative consequences that the Regulations may have for fundamental rights as enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. In particular, it examines whether the interoperability between EU information systems could violate the rights related to data protection, rights of the child, prohibition of discrimination as well as principles of necessity and proportionality. © 2021 The Author(s).","data protection; EU information systems; fundamental rights; interoperability; migration; security",,"Blasi Casagran, C.; Serra Húnter, Spain",,"Oxford University Press",14617781,,,,"English","Hum.

Information in its different forms, whether paper-based or digital, has always been fundamental to decision-making conduct. Concretely, the premise holds that decisions shall be based on correct, full, and adequate knowledge and reasoning. Technological innovation has, however, magnified information capacities and significance. The article in that respect maintains that the 'decisional value' of automatically-processed information consequently also alters the nature of the respective decision-making - from a conventional type where the agent exercises discretion to a 'semi-automated' conduct in which automation inhibits the agent's decision-making capacity. The recognition of such transformation is necessary for the law to keep up with the technological progress and safeguard rights of individuals who are subjects of such semi-automated decisions. © 2021 Uitgeverij Paris.

The paper presents empirical research to explore one way in which migrants in Athens negotiate Eurodac; where alternative imaginaries informed ideas of ‘big’ and ‘small’ fingerprints, shaping interactions with the asylum service as well as secondary movement. I use Autonomy of Migration (AoM) theories to depict borders as places of ongoing conflict, subjectivity and transformation and introduce the work of Castoriadis’ social imaginaries and the radical imagination to explore migrants’ alternative imaginaries. I argue that these occur at points of friction, within the constraints of, and alongside, a dominant socio-technical imaginary driving the proliferation of biometric border controls. I believe this enables a deeper understanding of the autonomy with AoM theories. Here, autonomy is presented as instances of self-creation, spurred on through the radical imagination and shaping moments of uncontrollability, where the subjective dimension of migration informs both meanings of autonomy as well as alternative imaginaries. Ultimately, I argue that these practices seek to disrupt and challenge the dominance of biometrics as a signifier of control, identity and truth. © 2021 The Author(s).

Through the SIS II, national authorities exchange information about individuals and objects, and this across national and institutional boundaries. Yet, the SIS II does not always perform as anticipated in its design scripts. Following common threads about infrastructural politics across Science and Technology Studies, political geography and critical security studies, we explore fragility and maintenance as being intrinsic to the functioning of data infrastructures and crucial sites of governance. We show how the SIS II is kept under continuous control to operate as a controlling data infrastructure. This article contributes to a critical inquiry into the datafication of border controls by interrogating how data acquire the status of allegedly credible and accurate information. Ultimately, this approach pinpoints the inherent fragility of seemingly mighty data infrastructures and casts a light on those actors and processes that sustain, through maintenance, contemporary digital borders. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"border region; database; European Union; geopolitics; information system; police force; Europe","Bellanova, R.; Department of Political Science, Netherlands; email: georgios.glouftsios@unitn.it",,"Routledge",14650045,,GEOPF,,"English","Geopolit.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095837210

Such identity management is predicated on the establishment of a biometric super-layer structure that cuts across databases without dissolving their legal foundations and introduces a new mode of ‘truth’ production in the form of a dedicated ‘identity confirmation file’ that is supposed to re-introduce a reliable baseline for the government of the Schengen area. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"border region; European Union; identity construction; international relations; state role; Europe","Leese, M.; Center for Security Studies, Switzerland; email: matthias.leese@sipo.gess.ethz.ch",,"Routledge",14650045,,GEOPF,,"English","Geopolit.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094136096
