The EU's databases in the Area of Freedom Security and Justice (AFSJ) for policing and migration purposes will be interconnected. This constitutes a paradigm shift for purpose limitation as a core element of data protection. This article identifies regulatory patterns and shortcomings in the technical and legal data protection arrangements of the interoperability regulations. The legal framework for data protection in the EU has developed considerably with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2016/679 and with Directive 2016/680 for policing and criminal justice. The European Data Protection Board, a multilevel accountability forum in which European and national data protection authorities cooperate has been established. From a trans-disciplinary legal, public administration, and public policy perspective, this article analyses the regulatory patterns and institutional settings established for the upcoming interoperability of databases for policing and migration. © 2020 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands","accountability; data protection; EU external borders; EU migration and policing databases; eu-LISA; Europol; inter-operability; police information sharing; privacy; Schengen Information System; Visa Information System",,"(2019), p. 27. , 1 OJ L 135 of 22 May at (Regulation 2019/817) and 85 (Regulation 2019/818); The ‘package' included: European Commission, Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on establishing a framework for interoperability between EU information systems (borders and visa) and amending Council Decision 2004/512/EC, Regulation (EC) No 767/2008, Council Decision 2008/633/JHA, Regulation (EU) 2016/399 and Regulation (EU) 2017/2226, Brussels: COM(2017) 793 final; European Commission, Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on establishing a framework for interoperability between EU information systems (police and judicial cooperation, asylum and migration), , 2 Brussels: COM(2017) 794 final; Bischof, B.

Current debates on this issue have been largely restricted to a technologically determinist approach that reduces the focus to problems of data misuse and privacy, precluding other pertinent ethical and political concerns. In response, the article engages with Giorgio Agamben's elaborations on the concepts of biopolitics and exception as an alternative way of analysing the use of biometric technology in the governance of forced migrants. It begins with a critical overview of Agamben's conceptualization of biopolitics and the state of exception. It then considers the Eurodac database and the UK's asylum Application Registration Cards as examples to demonstrate how current policies of immigration control and border management are implicated in the logic of exception. It argues that illiberal practices, such as biometric profiling and fingerprinting of asylum seekers and their incarceration in detention centres, are being enforced upon certain groups in ways that render their exclusion from the official juridico-political structure as an 'inclusive exclusion'. Importantly, the function creep of biometrics is not to be understood as the turning of exception into the rule in a somewhat homogenous way, but more as a polysemic process, which involves different forms of discipline and control that are irreducible to one singular paradigm. © The Author 2013.Published by Oxford University Press.All rights reserved.","Agamben; Asylum; Biometrics; Biopolitics; ICTs; Refugees","asylum seeker; biometry; immigration policy; information and communication technology; national identity; political integration; refugee; social exclusion; United Kingdom","Agamben, G., (1998) Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life, , Stanford: Stanford University Press; Ajana, B., Surveillance and Biopolitics (2007) Electronic Journal of Sociology, , http://www.sociology.org/content/2007/__btihaj_surveillances.pdf; Ajana, B., Biometric Citizenship (2012) Citizenship Studies, 16 (7), pp. 851-870; Amoore, L., Biometric Borders: Governing Mobilities in the War on Terror (2006) Political Geography, 25 (3), pp. 336-351; Arendt, H., (1966) The Origins of Totalitarianism, , London: Harcourt Brace Jovanovitch; Arendt, H., (1969) On Violence, , New York: Harcourt Brace; Aus, J.P., Supranational Governance in an ""Area of Freedom, Security and Justice"":Eurodac and the Politics of Biometric Control (2003), http://www.sussex.ac.uk/sei/documents/wp72.pdf; Balibar, E., (2002) Politics and the Other Scene, , London: Verso; Bailey, R., Up Against the Wall: Bare Life and Resistance in Australian Immigration Detention (2009) Law and Critique, 20 (2), pp. 113-120; Bauman, Z., (2002) Society Under Siege, , London: Polity; Bigo, D., Globalized-in-security: the Field and the Ban-opticon (2005), http://www.wmin.ac.uk/sshl/pdf/CSDBigo170106.pdf; Bigo, D., Security, Exception, Ban and Surveillance (2006), In Lyon, D.

New cross-border regimes of biometrics and databasing in the EU are con-tributing to a conflation of the treatment of irregularity, asylum seeking, and criminality. States provide migrants’ biometric data to transnational databases that are increasingly interoperable in the area of migration and crime control, to be accessible for state-based law enforcement actors. This article uses the case of Eurodac – a biometric database initially developed for migration control purposes – to explore the ongoing expansion of law enforcement access to the collected information for the purpose of crime control. The article studies how borders are selectively made permeable for biometric data flows in the light of “crimmigration” discourses. It combines insights from critical migration, border, and security studies that address the increasing overlapping of migration and crime control in policy discourse, law, and surveillance technologies. The study addresses the reconfiguration of crimmi-gration – and the normalisation and diversification of the figure of the “crim-migrant other” – through the expansion of cross-border flows of biometric data by law enforcement. © 2021, GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences.

Through the SIS II, national authorities exchange information about individuals and objects, and this across national and institutional boundaries. Yet, the SIS II does not always perform as anticipated in its design scripts. Following common threads about infrastructural politics across Science and Technology Studies, political geography and critical security studies, we explore fragility and maintenance as being intrinsic to the functioning of data infrastructures and crucial sites of governance. We show how the SIS II is kept under continuous control to operate as a controlling data infrastructure. This article contributes to a critical inquiry into the datafication of border controls by interrogating how data acquire the status of allegedly credible and accurate information. Ultimately, this approach pinpoints the inherent fragility of seemingly mighty data infrastructures and casts a light on those actors and processes that sustain, through maintenance, contemporary digital borders. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"border region; database; European Union; geopolitics; information system; police force; Europe","Adey, P., Facing airport security: Affect, biopolitics, and the preemptive securitisation of the mobile body (2009) Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 27, pp. 274-295; Amoore, L., Algorithmic war: Everyday geographies of the war on terror (2009) Antipode, 41 (1), pp. 49-69; Amoore, L., Data derivatives.

It highlights how the making of a controlled space is, first and foremost, a mise-en-discours going well beyond surveillance and prohibition: a continuous effort to make sense of a disparate multiplicity, encompassing both human and nonhuman elements, both controlled and controlling ones.

The ambition behind the European information systems - like the Schengen Information System and Eurodac - is to establish a single Union information system to control the flux of migrants. We show that in this process information technology is not a neutral tool to reach established goals but that it is 'greedy'. This greediness indicates the distorting potential of information technology regarding the means-end logic. Our analysis suggests that the European migration policy is stuck in a 'digital fix', i.e. a technological fix focusing on ICT. We identify three political issues concerning greedy information technology within the context of the European migration policy. The first issue concerns the democratic control on information systems. The second issue discusses the weak legal position of immigrants. The third issue inquires into the effectiveness of information systems as a policy instrument. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2010.","digital borders; European migration policy; illegal immigrants; information technology; Schengen information system",,"Baldaccini, A., Counter-terrorism and the EU strategy for border security: Framing suspects with biometric documents and databases (2008) European Journal of Migration and Law, 10, pp. 31-49. , at 47; Amoore, L., Biometric borders: Governing mobilities in the war on terror (2006) Political Geography, 25, pp. 336-351; Vedder, A., (2007) Van Privacyparadijs Tot Controlestaat?

Changes in EU policies are not only the consequences of ‘grand moments’ of treaty and institutional changes. In order to identify and explain changes in everyday decision-making, one should complement the traditional strategic bargaining perspective on decision-making with a constructivist view on discourse or language as sources of change. With the insights of both constructivists and communication theorists, this study focuses on the identification of conditions and occurrences of deliberation in the daily running of decision-making in the EU that allow for changes facilitating the adoption of new policy instruments. In this light a study of two cases will be presented of which each has taken place in a different institutional setting. The main analysis of this study is on the drafting process of the Framework Decision on the European Evidence Warrant of 2008. The findings of this analysis will be compared to findings of another analysis. It concerns the negotiations on the Council Decision of 2008 regarding access for consultation of the Visa Information System by law enforcement authorities. Analysis of both cases learned that in certain circumstances instances of deliberation and ensuing progress towards a more reasoned understanding actually occurred. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Constructivism; EU criminal justice; EU justice and home affairs; European Evidence Warrant; Visa Information System",,"Bächtiger, A., Niemeyer, S., Neblo, M., Steiner, J., Steenbergen, M., Empirical blind spots and normative trade-offs in deliberative democracy (2010) Journal of Political Philosophy, 18 (1), pp. 32-63; Burley, A.M., Mattli, W., Europe before the court: A political theory of legal integration (2006) Debates on European Integration.

Current developments in EU internal security policy, such as increased information sharing (which includes the exchange of personal data between European law enforcement agencies and judicial actors in the area of freedom, security and justice (Europol, Eurojust, Frontex and OLAF)) and the access of EU agencies, in particular Europol and Eurojust, to data stored in European information systems such as the SIS (II), VIS, CIS or Eurodac raise interesting questions regarding the balance between the rights of individuals and security interests. This book deals with the complexity of the relations between these actors and offers for the first time a comprehensive overview of the structures for information exchange in the area of freedom, security and justice and their compliance with data protection rules in this field. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

In addition, the access of law enforcement and judicial agencies (Europol, Eurojust) to data stored in the European information systems, such as the CIS, SIS (II), VIS or Eurodac seems to become an essential tool in the field of EU internal security policy. Without being limited by the former pillar constraints, and above all, in absence of a unified approach to data protection in the former third pillar, the main actors in this field increasingly exchange data between each other as well as with third states. The paper illustrates the existing and the planned instruments governing AFSJ data exchange as well as their compliance with data protection rules. After that it suggests some basic data protection standards which follow from the respect of Article 8 ECHR and would improve the respect of data protection rules in the field of information sharing between agencies and EU agencies and information system. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.",,,"Communication, C., (2010) Ona comprehensive strategy on data protectionin the european union, 13, p. 2.3. , COM(2010) 609 final of 4 November 2010, para; De, B., Joint investigation teams: The participation of europol officials (2007) ERA Forum, 8, p. 263; De, H., European police and judicial information-sharing, cooperation: Incorporation into the community, bypassing and extension of schengen (2004) ERA Forum, 5, pp. 425-434; De, M., The difficulties of joint investigation teams and the possible role of olaf (2009) Eucrim, 94-99 (97), p. 3; De, S., The two europes of human rights: The emerging division of tasks between the council of europe and the european union in promoting human rights in europe (2008) Columbia Journal of European Law, 14, pp. 509-560; Garside, A., The political genesis and legal impact of proposals for the sis ii: What cost for data protection and security in the eu?

Because borders and immigration policy alone cannot stop irregular migration, many governments turn to internal migration control on settled irregular migrants. Surveillance of this group is aimed at their exclusion from key societal institutions, discouraging their stay and ultimately, the deportation of apprehended irregular migrants. These are policies in which identification of irregular migrants is crucial. In this age, registration and identification mean computerized and networked databases. The member states of the EU are currently developing a network of databases in the field of (irregular) immigration. The Schengen Information System (II), the Eurodac database and the Visa Information System are vast databases, often including biometric data, aimed at controlling migration flows and identifying and sorting legal and irregular migrants. These systems are able to 're-identify' parts of the population of irregular migrants on the basis of digital traces of their migration history. It is argued that the digital infrastructure that is now growing past its infancy is developing into a formidable tool for the surveillance of irregular migrants in Europe. ©International Sociological Association.","Databases; European Union; Irregular migration; Social sorting; Surveillance",,"Aus, J., (2003) 'Supranational Governance in An ""area of Freedom, Security and Justice"": Eurodac and the Politics of Biometric Control', , www.sussex.ac.uk/sei/documents/wp72.pdf, Sussex European Institute; at:; Bauman, Z., (1998) Globalization: The Human Consequences, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Bauman, Z., (2000) Liquid Modernity, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Bigo, D., 'Criminalisation of ""migrants"": The Side Effect of the Will to Control the Frontiers and the Sovereign Illusion' (2004) Irregular Migration and Human Rights: Theoretical, European and International Perspectives, pp. 90-127. , B.

The exclusion of 'unwanted aliens' can be based on the mutual enforcement of national decisions, such as entry bans reported in the Schengen Information System, or objections against the issuing of a Schengen visa, based on the consultation procedure in the Visa Code. This contribution focuses on the right of TCNs to have access to effective remedies, both with regard to existing and newer mechanisms of exclusion. It argues that when dealing with the use of large-scale databases and risk assessment as basis for excluding admission, existing rules and case-law by the CJEU should be taken into account to ensure access to effective judicial protection for TCNs. © Evelien Brouwer, 2021","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; ECRIS-TCN; Effective remedy; Entry bans; ETIAS; Mutual trust; Risk assessment; SIS II; Visa code",,"Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 on the establishment, operation and use of the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) (2006) OJ, p.

Aiming to contribute to the literature on the Commission’s inner workings, this article draws comparisons between the levels of influence that two Commissioners were able to exert in the course of two legislative drafting processes; one of these efforts resulted in the Commission proposal for a Climate and Energy Framework, and the other aimed at introducing a Smart Border Package. Based on document analysis and interviews, it is argued that the influence of a particular Commissioner is best explained by a combination of institutional and discursive analysis. While low levels of interdepartmental coordination serve to increase the discretion of Commissioners, their level of influence also depends on their ability to justify their position with value-based arguments. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","border management; climate and energy policy; European Commission; institutional constraints; legitimation; policy formulation",,"Bauer, M.W., Ege, J., Politicisation within the European Commission’s Bureaucracy (2012) International Review of Administrative Sciences, 78 (3), pp. 403-424; Béland, D., Ideas, Institutions, and Policy Change (2009) Journal of European Public Policy, 16 (5), pp. 701-718; Béland, D., Carstensen, M.B., Seabrooke, L., Ideas, Political Power and Public Policy (2016) Journal of European Public Policy, 23 (3), pp. 315-317; Bocquillon, P., Dobbels, M., An Elephant on the 13th Floor of the Berlaymont?

The European Commission has recently proposed a legislative package on “EU Smart Borders” composed of an Entry-Exit System (EES) and the Registered Travellers Programme (RTP). This article examines the ways in which the EU Smart Borders reframe the traditional understandings and configurations of the EU border control system and its migration management toolkit of technologies. It is argued that smart borders take us a step further in the re-framing of mobility and identity controls in the EU Schengen apparatus. EU discourses backing up these measures have not been so much centered on the insecuritization of irregular immigration. They have instead questioned the effectiveness of the existing EU border regime, and used a “de-securitization” and facilitation of the mobility discourse hiding “discrimination by default.” Smart borders aim at identifying the future potential “irregular overstayer” and generalizing the management of mobility and identity of all non-EU travelers by implementing a person-driven approach. This approach transforms the essence of border controls in Europe and reframes the EU travel documents policy by moving away from a nationality-based approach of border controls towards another based on risk and profiling. © 2015 Association for Borderlands Studies.",,,"Amoore, L., Biometric Borders: Governing Mobilities in the War on Terror (2006) Political Geography, 25 (2), pp. 336-351; Anderson, M., Bigo, D., What are EU Frontiers for and What Do They Mean (2003) Search of Europe's Borders, pp. 7-25. , Groenendijk K., Guild E., Minderhoud P., (eds), The Hague: Kluwer Law International; Basaran, T., (2011) Security, Law and Borders: At the Limits of Liberties, , Abingdon: Routledge Studies in Liberty and Security; Bell, M., Invisible Actors?

The right to move freely represents one of the fundamental freedoms of the internal market as well as an essential political element of the package of rights linked to the very status of EU citizenship. The scope ratione personae and the current state of the principle of free movement of persons is assessed by looking at the most recent case law of the Court of Justice and the recently adopted Directive on the rights of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States. But what are the hidden and visible obstacles to free movement of persons in Europe? How can these barriers be overcome to make free movement and residence rights more inclusive? This article addresses these issues along with the following questions: Who are the beneficiaries of the free movement of persons in an enlarged Europe? What is the impact of the recent legal developments in the freedom of movement dimension, such as the European Court of Justice case law and the new Directive? And to what extent are pro-security policies such as the Schengen Information System II and an enhanced interoperability between European databases fully compatible with the freedom of movement paradigm?. © 2017 Wiley.

This chapter analyzes the appetite for identification and identity in the context of a post-bipolar, post-Westphalian and globalized world. It examines how it is intrinsically related to the transformations of security preoccupations and to the perceptions of the enemy in the new context as well as to the fear of the unknown and uncertainty. Schengen Information System (SIS) is a computerized information system on persons, stolen vehicles, and objects for the use of border control authorities, customs, and national police. It relies on increased policing behind borders and extensive cross-border police cooperation between Schengen members. The chapter asserts that the enhanced development of identification and surveillance technologies leads to the creation of what Laudon calls a ""dossier society"". It concludes by stressing the shift to a new form of surveillance generated by these transformations. © Didier Bigo and Elspeth Guild 2005.",,,,"Ceyhan, A.; University of ParisFrance; email: ayseceyhan@hotmail.com",,"Taylor and Francis",,9781351948715; 9780754630111,,,"English","Controlling Frontiers: Free Movement Into and Within Europe",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082273333

Since it came into service in March 1995, the system has proved to be highly reliable technically, and on a daily basis it makes it possible to carry out arrests pending extradition, or to discover stolen vehicles throughout the Schengen area. The operation of such a system can only be conceivable within a framework for the respect of individual freedom. It is for this reason that the agreement lays down strict criteria regarding personal data protection, as well as an inspection procedure operated at two different levels by the national inspection authorities (the CNIL for France) and a common independent inspection authority, set up by the Schengen Member States.",,,"Cet article est publié sous la responsabilité de son auteur.

At the same time, the way in which the ongoing interoperability initiatives regarding the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ) databases may influence Europol’s international cooperation raises arguably a set of new legal and practical questions that require urgent consideration. This article examines these issues by connecting the Europol-specific legal framework and international practice to the recently adopted AFSJ interoperability regulations as well as to the EU broader data protection framework. It looks more specifically at the balance between data protection/fundamental rights and operational effectiveness throughout Europol’s legal framework and practice of international cooperation and examines the implications of interoperability of AFSJ databases on this. On the one hand, interoperability of AFSJ databases is likely to boost Europol as an information hub through extended personal data collection and data processing possibilities, thereby making the Agency more attractive to international partners. On the other hand, the possibility to transfer such data outside the EU requires strong and effective safeguards from a data protection perspective. The article tentatively concludes that Europol’s current legal and practical framework for international cooperation seems to tilt the balance on the side of operational effectiveness to the detriment of data protection and fundamental rights, and that the new possibilities offered by the interoperability of AFSJ databases will further enhance this trend. © 2020 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands","AFSJ databases; data protection; effective police cooperation; Europol; fundamental rights; international cooperation; interoperability",,"(2017) Maximillian Schrems v.

Since the biggest group of people who are age-estimated in Denmark are Afghans, the author looks at the relationship between Denmark and Afghanistan and draws on interviews with people who underwent the process. By connecting medical documents with biometric measurement in colonial contexts and the current expansion of biometric surveillance, the author argues that the collection of intrusive physical data from Afghan minors is to be understood as a colonial mapping of the body. The Danish Immigration Service’s age decision-making process articulates a form of administrative rule that works to depoliticise questions of dispossession and death, and is a form of colonial violence enabled by humanitarian discourse and law. © 2020 Institute of Race Relations.","Afghanistan; biometric surveillance; Danish Immigration Service; Denmark; Eurodac; imperialist technology; medical age assessments; unaccompanied minors; ‘war on terror’","Afghan; Afghanistan; article; asylum seeker; biometry; decision making; Denmark; human; immigration; interview; medical assessment; violence","Arce, J., Suárez-Krabbe, J., Racism, global apartheid and disobedient mobilities: the politics of detention and deportation in Europe and Denmark (2018) KULT: postkolonial temaserie, 15, p. 21. , ‘, ’, p; Sudbury, J., A world without prisons: resisting militarism, globalized punishment, and empire (2004) Social Justice, 31 (1-2), p. 10. , ‘, ’, p; Gordon, A.F., Abu Ghraib: imprisonment and the war on terror (2006) Race & Class, 48 (1), p. 54. , July, ‘, ’, p; Gilmore, R.W., (2007) Golden Gulag: prisons, surplus, crisis, and opposition in globalizing California, p. 37. , http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/kbdk/detail.action?docID=1873254, Berkerley, CA, University of California Press, (, :,), p; A world without prisons: resisting militarism, globalized punishment, and empire, p. 11. , ‘, ’, p; (2018) Press Release: EU Budget - Commission Proposes Major Funding Increase for Stronger Borders and Migration, , http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-4106_en.htm, June, ‘, ’; UUI Alm.Del Endeligt Svar På Spørgsmål 322, , ‘, ’ (Udlændinge- og Integrationsministeriet, January 2017).

This paper examines the question from the perspective of a series of interlinked concrete forms of misbehaviour (data and systems interference, spam, spyware, identity theft) and procedural issues (multi-loci problems, data retention), placing special attention on the legal potential of both 'European' texts as a response to cybercrime threats.© érès.

L 190/1 18.07.2002; Terms such as 'cyber-crime', 'computer crime', and 'network crime' have no universally accepted definitions. Part of the confusion arising from their use comes from the fact that criminals now use computers in the course of committing almost any crime. The computer's role in an offence, however, can be characterized in one of three ways: as a tool, as a storage device, or as a victim.

Information in its different forms, whether paper-based or digital, has always been fundamental to decision-making conduct. Concretely, the premise holds that decisions shall be based on correct, full, and adequate knowledge and reasoning. Technological innovation has, however, magnified information capacities and significance. The article in that respect maintains that the 'decisional value' of automatically-processed information consequently also alters the nature of the respective decision-making - from a conventional type where the agent exercises discretion to a 'semi-automated' conduct in which automation inhibits the agent's decision-making capacity. The recognition of such transformation is necessary for the law to keep up with the technological progress and safeguard rights of individuals who are subjects of such semi-automated decisions. © 2021 Uitgeverij Paris.

The decrease of the security deficit by the control of immigration flow consists of three endeavours: the common border control policy, the common visa policy and the common asylum policy. The aim of this paper is to analyse and evaluate the development of the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice. The development process of these systems is not more than their integration into the so-called IT Agency. This new regulatory agency was established in January 2012. It has merged the operational management tasks of the further developed version of SIS (the SIS II), VIS and EURODAC and it is flexible to add other existing and potential new systems. Hence, the added-value of the IT Agency is to be assessed, since new technologies shall be harnessed to meet the requirements of enhancing security and facilitating travel at the external borders.","facilitate travel; information power; large-scale IT systems; Schengen; security deficit",,,"Dóczi, Z.; Corvinus University of Budapest, Közraktár u. 4-6, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary",,,12162574,,,,"English","Acta Juridica Hung.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878434229

It maintains existing offences and criminalizes new activities such as illegal interception and the usage of certain tools for committing offences. The offence that is the focus of this article – illegal access to information systems – is set out in Article 3. It represents a change from the wording of Art 2 (2) of the Framework Decision 2005/222/JHA in that under Art 3 of the Directive the incrimination of illegal access to information systems now depends upon whether such access infringes a security measure. This paper provides an overview of the impetus for the introduction of cybercrime laws and analysis of the key provisions of the Directive before exploring whether the wording of Art 3 is a sensible legislative approach. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","cybercrime; illegal access to information systems; security measures",,"Beck, U., (1992) Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity, , London: Sage Publications; Calkins, M., They Shoot Trojan Horses, Don't They - An Economic Analysis of Anti-Hacking Regulatory Models (2000) Georgetown Law Journal, 89, pp. 171-224; Clough, J., (2010) Principles of Cybercrime, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Correia, M.P., Sousa, P.J., (2010) Segurança no Software, , Lisboa: FCA–Editora informática; Downing, D., Covington, M., Covington, M., Covington, C., (2009) Dictionary of Computer and Internet Terms, , 10th ed, Hauppauge: Barron's Educational Series; Fafinski, S., (2009) Computer Misuse Response, Regulation and the Law, , Devon: Willan Publishing; Greyes, N., A New Proposal for the Department of Justice's Interpretation of the Computer Fraud & Abuse Act (2013) Virginia Journal of Law & Technology, 17 (4), pp. 293-353; Halbert, D., Discourses of Danger and the Computer Hacker (1997) The Information Society: An International Journal, 13 (4), pp. 361-374; Harper, A., Harris, S., Ness, J., Eagle, C., Lenkey, G., Williams, T., (2011) Gray Hat Hacking the Ethical Hackers Handbook, , 3rd ed, New York: McGraw-Hill; Herrera-Flanigan, J., Ghosh, S., Criminal Regulations (2010) Cybercrimes: A Multidisciplinary Analysis, pp. 265-308. , Ghosh S., Turrini E., (eds), London: Springer; Himma, K., Ethical Issues Involving Computer Security: Hacking, Hacktivism, and Counterhacking (2008) The Handbook of Information and Computer Ethics, pp. 191-217. , Himma Kenneth, Tavani Herman, (eds), New Jersey: John Wiley & Sons; Jahankhani, H., Watson, D., Me, G., Leonhardt, F., (2010) Handbook of Electronic Security and Digital Forensics, , Singapore: World Scientific Publishing Company; Jordan, T., Taylor, P., (2004) Hacktivism and Cyberwars: Rebels with a Cause?, , London: Routledge; Kshetri, N., (2010) The Global Cybercrime Industry, , London: Springer; Matwyshyn, A., (2009) Harboring Data: Information Security, Law, and the Corporation, , Stanford: Stanford Law Books; McQuade, S., (2009) Encyclopedia of Cybercrime, , Westport: Greenwood Press; Moore, R., (2010) Cybercrime: Investigating High-Technology Computer Crime, , 2nd ed, Anderson Cincinatti: Ohio; Olivenbaum, J., Ctrl-Alt-Delete: Rethinking Federal Computer Crime Legislation (1997) Seton Hall Law Review, 27, pp. 574-642; Peterson, I.H.T.F., (2011) Nightwork: A History of Hacks and Pranks at MIT, , Cambridge: Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Pollaro, G., Disloyal Computer Use and the Computer.

Tracing the biopolitical problematisation of the border that led to ETIAS, I argue that the system embodies a shift towards data behaviourism in the regime of truth underlying the biopolitical regulation of the EU border. Data behaviourism establishes a new way of seeing conduct, adding a potential future layer to it. Taming future mobilities through data-mining and future-oriented algorithmic processing, ETIAS imagines mobile subjects in terms of their motility and thereby produces dividuals and blurs the spatio-temporal boundedness of the EU border. ETIAS thereby complicates resistance by avoiding fixed identities and instead rarefies subjects through seeing them as being constantly emergent through new correlations. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","biopolitics; border security; Circulation; data behaviourism; dividuals; technology","authoritarianism; correlation; European Union; international relations; political border; regional security; travel behavior; Europe","Adey, P., Facing Airport Security: Affect, Biopolitics, and the Preemptive Securitisation of the Mobile Body (2009) Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 27 (2), pp. 274-295; Alegre, S., Jeandesboz, J., Vavoula, N., (2017) European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS): Border Management, Fundamental Rights and Data Protection, , https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2017/583148/IPOL_STU(2017)583148_EN.pdf , Accessed November 17, 2019; Amoore, L., Data Derivatives.

This is fol-lowed by an analysis of the legal challenges arising from the establishment of so-called smart borders, i.e. borders involving automated border control and the interoperability of all large-scale information systems. The article poses two fundamental research questions. Firstly: how do these new phenomena affect the effectiveness of management of the external borders in the EU? Secondly: are the existing legal frameworks able to bear the changes that are occurring? It seems that the aspiration towards interoperability may cause ten-sions underlying the establishment and functioning of the area of freedom, security, and justice (AFSA) in the EU – if the EU’s information systems become more and more interoperable, then the EU legal order may become less and less consistent with them. © 2020 Author.","European Union; Integrated management of external borders; Interoperability; Large-scale information systems; New technologies; Smart borders",,"Bellanova, R., González-Fuster, G., Politics of Disappearance: Scanners and (Unobserved) Bodies as Mediators of Security Practices (2013) International Political Sociology, 7 (2); Beuving, M.A., Frontex.

They are the most advanced form of information exchange, conferring direct information access to competent authorities. Interoperable information systems are intended for the exchange of raw material for investigation purposes, which at a later stage could become evidence at trial. Interoperable information systems challenge existing cooperation dynamics and redefine the role of the actors involved. It is questionable whether mutual recognition and approximation, which have been considered the cornerstone of judicial cooperation in both civil and criminal matters for many years, can describe alone integration dynamics in law enforcement cooperation, particularly with reference to information sharing. This article appraises whether, and to what extent, law enforcement access to and use of interoperable information systems constitute new modes of law enforcement cooperation in the EU AFSJ. It then assesses what would be the implications of such a paradigm shift on information management. After a short overview of the main features of interoperability, it addresses whether and how the establishment and functioning of interoperable information systems actually or potentially redefines the existing distribution of tasks between th EU and Member States and among competent authorities of different kinds. © 2020 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands","approximation; Area of Freedom Security and Justice; European Union; information management; interoperability; law enforcement; mutual recognition; platform integration; principle of availability",,"Boehm, Franziska, (2012) Information Sharing and Data Protection in the Area of Freedom Security and Justice, , 1 (Springer); Ballaschk, Julia, (2015) Interoperability of Intelligence Networks in the European Union, , 2 Ballaschk describes the interoperability between three different kinds of network: vertical networks, which are structured networks established by a formal legal arrangement (e.g. EU agencies such as Europol); horizontal networks, which are characterized by a certain degree of informality (e.g. Prüm cooperation); and intermediate networks, which are either established by a formal legal arrangement but hav hierarchical structure or have a hierarchical structure but no formal legal basis (e.g. SIS, VIS, Eurodac).

It consists of two elements: data must be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes only (purpose specification); and data must not be further processed in a way that is incompatible with those purposes (compatible use). (Nomos); 63 More broadly, in law enforcement cooperation the principle of purpose limitation guarantees that the issuing law enforcement authority does not use the information obtained for other purposes.

Illustrated through an encounter between a migrant and the Visa Information System (VIS)–one of the largest migration-related biometric databases worldwide–the article’s first part outlines three implications of digitisation. We argue that the VIS assembles a set of previously unconnected state authorities into a group of end users who enact border security and migration management through the gathering, processing and sharing of data; facilitates the practice of traceability, understood as a rationality of mobility control; and has restrictive effects on migrants’ capacity to manoeuvre and resist control. Given these implications, the article’s second part introduces three analytical sensitivities that help to avoid some analytical traps when studying digitisation processes. These sensitivities take their cue from insights and concepts in science and technology studies (STS), specifically material semiotics/ANT approaches. They concern, firstly, the ways that data-based security practices perform the identities of the individuals that they target; secondly, the need to consider possible practices of subversion by migrants to avoid control-biased analyses; and finally, the challenge to study the design and development of border security technologies without falling into either technological or socio-political determinism. © 2020 The Author(s).

I do so by dwelling on the functionalities of information systems used, among other purposes, for border security. My argument is twofold. First, I contend that circulations are governed within nexuses of technologically mediated control practices (practice-networks) performed outside, at the edges of, and inside the Schengen area. Second, I show that information systems, borders, mobile bodies, and security rationales do not remain fixed throughout the process of governing circulations, but emerge, mutate and multiply through their ongoing (re)enactment within practice-networks. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","border security; Circulation; enactment; practice-networks; technology","European Union; political border; regional security; Europe","Adey, P., Secured and Sorted Mobilities: Examples from the Airport (2004) Surveillance and Society, 1 (4), pp. 500-519; Adey, P., Surveillance at the Airport: Surveilling Mobility/Mobilising Surveillance (2004) Environment and Planning a., 36, pp. 1365-1380; Adey, P., If Mobility is Everything Then It is Nothing: Towards a Relational Politics of (Im)Mobilities (2006) Mobilities, 1 (1), pp. 75-94. , 10, 1080/17450100500489080; Anderson, B., Preemption, Precaution, Preparedness: Anticipatory Action and Future Geographies (2010) Progress in Human Geography, 34 (6), pp. 777-798; Aradau, C., Political Grammars of Mobility, Security and Subjectivity (2016) Mobilities, 11 (4), pp. 564-574; Bærenholdt, J.O., Governmobility: The Powers of Mobility (2013) Mobilities, 8 (1), pp. 20-34; Barad, K., (2007) Meeting the Universe Halfway.

Global cybercrime is one of the biggest underworld industries, much of this crime is unreported, new forms of crimes occur. In the light of the new EU Directive (2013/40/EU of the European Parliament and of The Council on attacks against information systems and replacing Council Framework Decision 2005/222/JHA), the authors of the Article discuss if and how the new instrument helps to solve some of the aforementioned problems. The first part of the Article presents systemic and historic evaluation of the EU cybercrime policy in comparison with the Convention on Cybercrime. The second and third parts of the Article focus on two specific issues related to cybercrimes. The second part evaluates changes in the material criminal law introduced by the new Directive and their effectiveness in resolving the issue of harmonization. The last part of the paper is answering if introduced procedural changes are successful in providing framework of law enforcement cooperation and capacity to investigate. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",,,"Capus, N., (2007) Sovereignty and Criminal Law: The Dual Criminality Requirement in International Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, , Munich: Max Planck institute; Choo, K.-K.R., Grabosky, P., Cyber crime (2013) Oxford Handbook of Organized Crime, pp. 1-31. , L.

The entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam granted the European institutions a more prominent role in the drafting of policies regarding immigration, asylum and external borders management. However, the legislative texts only aim at a minimum harmonization of the member states policies. In fact, instead of a European asylum policy, what has emerged is a policy of non-access to asylum through a number of measures such as making visas compulsory to enter Europe, imposing penalties against carriers, or codifying the notions of ""safe"" countries and ""manifestly unfounded demands"". Rather than introducing a common policy, the Dublin agreements and the Eurodac data base have made it possible to send asylum seekers from country to country. Thus, European asylum policy shows little solidarity and benefits only the ministries of those countries which have elaborated an informal system as early as 1985 in order to stop welcoming asylum seekers. © 2013 Le Seuil.

It outlines the existing research, positions the empirics in this context and sets out how the database was constructed. Selected statistics on the EU and the USA are also presented. The dataset measures three key dimensions of mobility regimes: visa requirements, consular coverage abroad and issuing practices. It contains data on the EU-Schengen states in the period 2005-2012 for all third countries abroad, and similar but less extensive information on the UK and the USA. Hitherto, this material has not been available in a format easily amenable for research. The database collects and presents the public government data in a systematised and readily viewable form, thereby reducing entry barriers for future studies of migration control. It also contains a Mobility Barriers Index providing restrictiveness scores taking all three dimensions into account. The database thus seeks to facilitate and encourage further quantitative inquiry into mobility barriers, and provides a tool for qualitative researchers to contextualise their findings in a wider case universe. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Database; EU; Migration; Mobility; Schengen; Visa","database; European Union; international migration; mobility; United Kingdom; United States","Bauman, Z., (1998) Globalization: The Human Consequences, , New York,: Columbia University Press; Bigo, D., When Two Become One: Internal and External Securitisations in Europe (2000) International Relations Theory and the Politics of European Integration, Power, Security and Communit, pp. 171-204. , In: Kelstrup M., Williams M.

This article will present a critical assessment of the operation of the Convention in light of State practice and case-law in Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom and provide some suggestions towards its improvement. The underpinning of the 'Dublin system' is the principle of authorisation, under which the State which has 'authorised' the entry of an asylum seeker on the territory of the Member State is responsible for examining his or her application. The Convention sets out objective criteria to determine the responsible State in accordance with that principle. Complex procedural rules have also been adopted to implement the Convention, including the draft EURODAC instrument which organises a centralised database of asylum seekers' fingerprints. Yet, various problems have appeared in the operation of the Convention. The scope of the Convention does not include applications for humanitarian protection, the conditions for family reunification are too strictly defined, and most importantly the difficulty of providing strong evidence of illegal entry into one of the Member States renders the Convention useless in many cases. The application of the 'opt-out' clause, which creates a derogation to the criteria determining responsibility, is therefore quite common in humanitarian and family cases, but is also used by the authorities of the Member States to ensure the swift expulsion of asylum seekers. The very basis of the system, the principle of authorisation, should also be re-examined by the Commission which will present a proposal of Community instrument based on the Dublin instrument in the near future.",,,"(1997) European Communities, OJ L/254, p. 1. , The Dublin Convention (hereinafter DC) entered into force on 1 Oct. 1997 in Sweden and Austria, and on 1 Jan. 1998 in Finland. 19 Aug; (1991) ILM, 30, p. 84. , 1990 Schengen Convention on the Application of the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 relating to the Gradual Suppression of Controls at Common Frontiers, Between the Governments of State Members of the Benelux Economic Union, the Federal Republic of Germany and the French Republic, (hereafter SC); Bay Larsen, L., Schengen, the Third Pillar and Nordic Cooperation (1997) The Implementation of Schengen: First the Widening, Now the Deepening, p. 17. , M. den Boer (ed.), Maastricht, European Institute of Public Administration; Interview with Jean-Louis De Brouwer, Head of Unit External Frontier, Immigration and Asylum at the European Commission, 7 Jun. 1999; note; See Preamble of the DC; Müller-Graf, P.-C., The Dublin Convention̈: Pioneer and Lesson for Third-Pillar Conventions (1995) Justice and Home Affairs in the European Union: The Development of the Third Pillar, pp. 49-63. , R.

It starts by providing an historical overview of asylum and immigration law and policy in the European Union, from its origins to the changes introduced by the Lisbon Treaty and recast proposals of existing legislative instruments. In so doing, the article critically examines whether the European Union provides an adequate framework for protecting those seeking international protection both from the perspective of effectiveness and fairness and shows that despite some changes ensuring a stronger level of protection of asylum-seekers the recast process still does not ensure an equal standard of protection across European Union Member States. © The Author [2011].

In the context of improving security, recent initiatives have focused on the exchange of law enforcement information with effect in 2008 under the ""availability"" principle. This principle of availability was introduced in the Prüm Treaty, also known as Schengen III. The core element of the treaty is the creation of a network of national databases to promote the exchange of information between law enforcement authorities. In particular, reciprocal access is given to Contracting States' national databases, containing DNA profiles, fingerprints and vehicle registration data. Although this initiative started as a multilateral agreement, a small group of influential countries led by Germany has successfully twisted the arms of other EU countries into integrating the provisions of the agreement into the legislative framework of the European Union under the Third Pillar. The treaty has been incorporated into a Council Decision binding on all EU member states. While the treaty represents a progress in the field of cooperation against crime, the implications of this treaty are far reaching. It raises privacy and data protection issues which will affect all EU citizens, primarily due to the absence of common legally binding data protection standards. © 2008 Sylvia Kierkegaard.",,"Database systems; DNA; Electronic data interchange; International cooperation; Security of data; Data protection standards; DNA profiles; Law enforcement","","Kierkegaard, S.; International Association of IT LawyersDenmark",,"Elsevier Ltd",02673649,,CLSRE,,"English","Comput Law Secur Rep",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979834489

However, despite hundreds of thousands of fingerprints being processed through this system each year, Eurodac has received only very little media attention. In Europe, much of the public debate about the use of biometric technologies for the purpose of automated personal identification is centered on the gradual introduction of new biometric passports. To view biometric systems as "" black boxes "" leads to erroneous conclusions about their effectiveness, both from a technophobic and a technophile point of view. Rather, on a technical, socio-economic and historical level, they should be understood as complex systems that integrate smaller computer systems which are being sold to state and private actors by different manufacturers. The use of biometric identification systems at national borders can be seen as being part of communicative processes in the negotiation of access to resources and power. And the technology itself is a disputatious actor not least because of its unavoidable measurement errors (though categorizable) and unpredictable interactions with human actors. Thus, political responsibility for who is and who is not granted access cannot simply be devolved unto biometric systems as allegedly infallible and unambiguous technical authorities.","Automation of border crossings; Biometric border control; Biometric identification; Biometric identity; Biometrics; Identity check; Identity control; Technology assessment",,"Allen, R., Sankar, P., Prabhakar, S., Fingerprint identification technology (2005) Biometric Systems: Technology, Design and Performance Evaluation, pp. 21-61. , Wayman, James L. et al.

Lyon argues that modern surveillance always categorises people entailing social effects, what he conceptualises as social sorting. This paper assesses if patterns of social sorting can be found in the EU surveillance systems for migration Schengen Information System (SIS), Visa Information System (VIS) and EUROpean DACtylographic comparison system (EURODAC), which are planned to be merged in order to ensure maximum efficiency in surveillance. To do so, the paper analyses relevant documents referring to SIS, VIS and EURODAC. These systems have assumed the traditional border function of deciding on societal inclusion and exclusion. I argue that, to some extent, socio-digital borders are drawn along the categories established through social sorting. The paper exemplifies how social sorting relying on big data may be a disempowering surveillance practice. © 2016, Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society.

Eurodac, an information, communication and control technology operates by means of a European database, in which the fingerprints of asylum seekers and irregular migrants are stored. Eurodac works as a so-called Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) and is applied within the areas where the rules of the Dublin II regulation are applicable. By using the Eurodac database to reconstruct the one and only responsible Member State per asylum application Dublin II regulates the mobility of non-EU-citizens without a valid visa within the EU. We understand the present paper as an ethnographic contribution to the understanding of the socio-technological emergence of the digital border and the digitization of border conflicts. With recourse to Bruno Latour’s concepts of “blackboxing” and “immutable mobiles” we develop an analysis that allows us to describe some exemplary actor-networks of Eurodac following our multi-sited fieldwork. In this connection, we have localized the current crisis of the Schengen border regime at three different but interconnected spots: From Athens via Igoumenitsa to Bari and from there back and forth into European control centers. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Digital border; Digital deportability; Embodied identity of migration; EurodacEurodac",,"Amoore, L., Biometric borders: Governing mobilities in the war on terror (2006) Political Geography, 25, pp. 336-351; Amoore, L., Marmura, S., Salter, M.B., Editorial: Smart borders and mobilities: Spaces, zones, enclosures (2008) Surveillance & Society, 5 (2), pp. 96-101; Anzaldua, G., (1987) Borderlands—Lafrontera: The New Mestiza, , San Francisco, NC: Aunt Lute; Aus, J.P., (2003) Supranational Governance in an ‘Area of Freedom, Security and Justice’: Eurodac and the Politics of Biometric Control, , (SEI Working Paper 72)., University of Oslo: ARENA; Aus, J.P., (2006) Eurodac: A Solution Looking for A Problem?

Engaging the recently adopted interoperability initiative that is set to biometrically verify and cross-validate identity records between all European border management, migration, and security databases, it argues that interoperability presents a shift from traditional modes of identity production at the border towards a digital space of identity management. Such identity management is predicated on the establishment of a biometric super-layer structure that cuts across databases without dissolving their legal foundations and introduces a new mode of ‘truth’ production in the form of a dedicated ‘identity confirmation file’ that is supposed to re-introduce a reliable baseline for the government of the Schengen area. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"border region; European Union; identity construction; international relations; state role; Europe","Aas, K.F., ‘The body does not lie’: Identity, risk and trust in technoculture (2006) Crime, Media, Culture: An International Journal, 2 (2), pp. 143-158; Abomhara, M., Yayilgan, S.Y., Nymoen, A.H., Shalaginova, M., Székely, Z., Elezaj, O., How to do it right: A framework for biometrics supported border control (2020) E-Democracy–Safeguarding democracy and human rights in the digital age, pp. 94-109. , Katsikas S., Zorkadis V., (eds), Cham: Springer, and,. ed; Ajana, B., Biometric citizenship (2012) Citizenship Studies, 16 (7), pp. 851-870; Ajana, B., Asylum, identity management and biometric control (2013) Journal of Refugee Studies, 26 (4), pp. 576-595; Amoore, L., Biometric borders: Governing mobilities in the war on terror (2006) Political Geography, 25 (3), pp. 336-351; Amoore, L., (2013) The politics of possibility: Risk and security beyond probability, , Durham/London: Duke University Press; Anderson, B., Preemption, precaution, preparedness: Anticipatory action and future geographies (2010) Progress in Human Geography, 34 (6), pp. 777-798; (2014) What are biometrics?

As the RTP seeks to flexibilise border management through the notions of risk and trustworthiness, the article suggests that a Foucauldian account of biopolitics can serve as a capable analytical tool. A biopolitical approach conceptualises the RTP’s aims of business facilitation and border protection not as contradictory concepts, but rather as mutually constitutive and reinforcing elements. Thus, it helps to understand the current efforts to render the border “smart” in an attempt to govern security and the economy under a common framework—a framework, however, that commands critical investigation when it comes to the applied sorting mechanisms at the border. © 2016 University of Kent.",,,"Balibar, E., The Borders of Europe (1998) Cosmopolitics: Thinking and Feeling Beyond the Nation, 220p. , note; Hannam, K., Sheller, M., Urry, J., Editorial: Mobilities, Immobilities and Moorings (2006) Mobilities, 1 (1), pp. 1-22; Cresswell, T., Towards a Politics of Mobility (2010) Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 28 (1), pp. 17-31; Salter, M.B., To Make Move and Let Stop: Mobility and the Assemblage of Circulation (2013) Mobilities, 8 (1), pp. 7-19; (2013) COM(2013) 97 Final.

In this article, we critically evaluate that claim by developing a notion of deliberation along Habermasian lines, in which deliberation is understood as a process that induces negotiating partners to change positions through argumentation. Based on this conceptualization, we explore to what extent and under which conditions deliberation is likely to occur in intergovernmental settings. To that end, we analyse decision-making on the proposal to give law enforcement authorities access to the Visa Information System. We conclude that a ‘thicker’ conceptualization yields relatively few instances of deliberation.

The Prüm Process started as an intergovernmental data-sharing initiative of seven EU member states in 2005, before the key provisions of the founding Treaty were incorporated into EU law in 2007. It also induced some third countries, in particular the US, to strive for similar Prüm-like treaties-at times with considerable pressure, as this chapter's case study on the Austrian-US negotiations demonstrates. The chapter argues that the Prüm process reflects both the opportunities and challenges of enhanced cooperation in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. In terms of opportunities, the Prüm process has deepened EU cooperation in an area that was not yet regulated by EU law. Enhancing cooperation in combating serious crime by mutually opening up national databases would not have been possible in the EU framework given that some countries, notably the UK, blocked it. The signing of the Prüm Treaty outside the EU's legal framework has allowed the integration-willing member states to demonstrate the functional benefits of the initiative and to weaken the resistance of the cooperation-reluctant countries. In terms of challenges, however, criticism concerning the Prüm process' legitimacy and acceptability was not silenced, even after the incorporation of the key provisions into EU law. Issues of privacy and data protection were intensively negotiated, in particular in the EU-US cooperation triggered by the Prüm Process. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.

This reform, among other countless aspects, has increased the effective EU Information Management as the key to protect external borders, improve the management of migration flows and contribute to the enhancement of internal security. The applicable data protection legislation is significantly fragmented, complex and diffuse since, despite the GDPR excludes from its scope asylum-related activities, border control, and immigration is directly defined in the proposed Dublin IV, Procedures and Eurodac regulations. At the same time, the persistent linkages to the security of Member States can reflect the potential application of the Data Protection Directive on Police Matters. In addition, the interoperability of different information systems, the deployment of specific bodies (such as Frontex or EASO) as well as law enforcement authorities are bound directly by their own regulations. Consequently, this fragmented and particularly complex legal framework constitutes the subject of the study. © 2019 Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia.","Border security; CEAS reform; Data protection directive in in police matters; Dublin iv system; General data protection regulation; international protection; Protection and processing of asylum seekers personal data; Refugees; Subsidiary protection; UNHCR",,"García Mahamüt, R., La ductilidad del derecho a la protección internacional (refugio y protección subsidiaria) ante las crisis humanitarias: un desafío para Europa y para el Sistema Común de Asilo (2016) Teoría y Realidad Constitucional, (38), pp. 225 and 232; García Mahamüt, R., La ductilidad del derecho a la protección internacional Op. cit, pp. 211-238; López Aguilar, J.F., (2017) Europa: Parlamento y Derechos.

The entry ban entails that a non-citizen expelled from one member state is barred from returning to the whole Schengen area for up to five years, or longer in case of a threat to public policy or national security. The pan-European validity of the entry ban is ensured by an alert entered in the Schengen Information System (SIS). The alert is a set of personal data registered in the SIS which states may process to identify the person with a view of the refusal of entry. Processing personal data of non-citizens may pose a challenge to the protection of their data. The article assesses data protection rules laid down in the SIS Regulation (Regulation 1987/2006) and the Regulation which will replace it (Regulation 2018/1861). As it argues, SIS-specific data protection safeguards are frequently narrower than rules under data protection law, including the General Data Protection Regulation and Council of Europe Convention 108, and fall short of requirements flowing from the right to privacy under the European Convention of Human Rights and EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Data protection; entry ban; Returns Directive; right to privacy; Schengen Information System (SIS)",,"Baldaccini, A., The Return and Removal of Irregular Migrants Under EU Law: An Analysis of the Returns Directive (2009) EJML, 11 (1), pp. 1-17; Besters, M., Brom, F., 'Greedy’ Information Technology: The Digitalization of the European Migration Policy (2010) EJML, 12 (4), pp. 455-470; Broeders, D., Tracing, Identifying and Sorting: The Role of EU Migration Databases in the Internal Control on Irregular Migrants (2009) Migration and Mobility in Europe: Trends, Patterns and Control, pp. 249-271. , Fassmann H., Haller M., Lane D., (eds), Cheltenham: Elgar,. edited by; Brouwer, E., Data Surveillance and Border Control in the EU: Balancing Efficiency and Legal Protection (2006) Security Versus Freedom ?: A Challenge for Europe’s Future, pp. 137-154. , Balzacq T., Carrera S., (eds), Aldershot: Ashgate,. edited by; Brouwer, E., (2008) Digital Borders and Real Rights: Effective Remedies for Third-Country Nationals in the Schengen Information System, , Leiden: Nijhoff; Brouwer, E., Legal Boundaries and the Use of Migration Technology (2011) Migration and the New Technological Borders of Europe, pp. 134-169. , Dijstelbloem H., Meijer A., (eds), Basingstoke: Palgrave,. edited by; Brouwer, E., Interoperability of Databases and Interstate Trust: a Perilous Combination for Fundamental Rights (2019) Verfassungsblog, , https://verfassungsblog.de/interoperability-of-databases-and-interstate-trust-a-perilous-combination-for-fundamental-rights/; (2009) College van burgemeester en wethouders van Rotterdam v.

The main purpose of the article is to analyze and evaluate the key changes prepared by the European Commission. The author offers a brief overview of the seven bills covering various issues related to migration: the Dublin procedure, the Eurodac system, the EU Agency for asylum, reception conditions and the procedure for granting international protection, the qualification of third-country nationals or stateless persons as beneficiaries of international protection, as well as a Union Resettlement Framework. The author comes to the conclusion that it will be extremely difficult for the EU to reach unanimity because of the divergent views on the migration problem's solution.","Common European Asylum System; European Union; Immigrants; International protection; Reform",,"(2011) Judgment of the Court (Second Chamber) of 28 July 2011, Brahim Samba Diouf V.

The paper presents empirical research to explore one way in which migrants in Athens negotiate Eurodac; where alternative imaginaries informed ideas of ‘big’ and ‘small’ fingerprints, shaping interactions with the asylum service as well as secondary movement. I use Autonomy of Migration (AoM) theories to depict borders as places of ongoing conflict, subjectivity and transformation and introduce the work of Castoriadis’ social imaginaries and the radical imagination to explore migrants’ alternative imaginaries. I argue that these occur at points of friction, within the constraints of, and alongside, a dominant socio-technical imaginary driving the proliferation of biometric border controls. I believe this enables a deeper understanding of the autonomy with AoM theories. Here, autonomy is presented as instances of self-creation, spurred on through the radical imagination and shaping moments of uncontrollability, where the subjective dimension of migration informs both meanings of autonomy as well as alternative imaginaries. Ultimately, I argue that these practices seek to disrupt and challenge the dominance of biometrics as a signifier of control, identity and truth. © 2021 The Author(s).

This Article intends to shine a light from a legal perspective on the ambivalence of the means and ends of the ETIAS database. ETIAS is not solely an instrument of migratory flow management. It is also, more discretely, a criminal justice instrument. In addition to the administrative function of ETIAS, there is a law-enforcement capability: once data pertaining to candidates seeking travel authorization is collected, it becomes available to ends which are estranged from the administrative function of ETIAS. This Article intends to highlight the opaque nature of ETIAS resulting from its cumulating complexities at the crossroads of law and information technology, EU and member states competences, administrative and criminal laws. ETIAS is indicative of a more global model that it is helping to deploy, suggesting the prospect of a data set pertaining to migrants and available for criminal purposes. In conclusion, this Article raises the following questions: is ETIAS compatible with fundamental liberties? And in this respect should its hidden criminal dimension raise concerns? © 2021.

The structure of the listing is surprising: law enforcement operates through a penal procedure includes such investigations. It is therefore difficult to make a completely different purpose from this third term, unless perhaps the pleonasm is being used rhetorically; 62 An initial reference concerns the terrorist offences referred to in the Directive 2017/541/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2017 on combating terrorism and replacing Council Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA and amending Council Decision 2005/671/JHA. A second concerns the offences referred to in Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA of the Council of 13 June 2002 on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States, art, (2). , 2; Art. 1(2) Regulation, , 63 2018/1240 cit; Regulation (EU) 604/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national or a stateless person, , 64 Art. 1(2); 65 Directive 2016/681/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the use of passenger name record (PNR) data for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime, , These data concerning the travel conditions of air passengers enable the competent authorities to identify those passengers representing a threat to internal security who are involved in a terrorist offence or another serious crime; 66 This organic duality must be put into perspective, in as much as art. 50 of Regulation 2018/1240 states that the designated authority and the central access point “can form part of the same organisation”; Art. 51(4) Regulation, , 67 2018/1240 cit; 68 Ibid. art. 53. According to art. 53(3) Regulation 2018/1240, the Europol requests for consultation of data ""shall be subject to prior verification by a specialised unit of duly empowered Europol officials""; 69 Ibid. art. 4(e) and art. 23(1), specify the SIS notifications/reports of which the applicant may be the subject, supported by the comparison with ETIAS data made by the ETIAS central system; , p. 17. , 70 Ibid. art; Only one datum gathered from the applicant is excluded from the consultation for penal purposes: the studies carried out by the interested party (see art. 52(4) in fine, referring to art. 17(2)(h) Regulation, , 71 Ibid. arts 50 ff. 2018/1240 cit); 72 The reasoning would be different if the offences for which the law enforcement authorities are authorised to consult ETIAS were related, at least, to migration in general. And yet, that is not the case. The offences in question are defined by a set of references to two instruments with no relationship to migration: on the one hand, the Directive 2017/541 cit. for terrorist offences; and on the other hand, the offences listed in Framework Decision 2002/584, for “other serious criminal offences”, art. 2(2) cit. Unrelated to border management, these instruments list offences that have no particular link with the migration issue -except, for instance, facilitation of unauthorised entry and residence. The reference made by the ETIAS regulation to these instruments is therefore not based on an analogy between their respective purposes; Stumpf, J, The Crimmigration Crises: Immigrants, Crime, and Sovereign Power (2006) AmULRev, p. 367. , 73 About “crimmigration in particular; 74 European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) Opinion on the amended proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the establishment of ‘Eurodac' for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of Regulation (EC) (establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national or a stateless person), and on the proposal for a Council Decision on requesting comparisons with Eurodac data by Member States' law enforcement authorities and Europol for law enforcement purposes of 7 October 2009, para. 47. The words are evocative, taken from a landmark judgement of the European Court of Human Rights ruling against the United Kingdom for being in breach of art. 8 of the Convention, , (ECtHR S and Marper the United Kingdom Ap 30562/04 an 30566/04 [4 December 2008] para. 122). The petitioners denounced the storage, after they had been cleared, of personal data collected when they were suspects in criminal proceedings.

Steps in this direction have taken the form of initiatives aiming both at eliminating obstacles to the exchange of personal data between national authorities and at creating EU-wide structures and databases. The emphasis on developing EU-wide databases can be witnessed in both the immigration and asylum field (with the establishment of the EURODAC and Schengen Information System (SIS) databases and proposals to establish a Visa Information System (VIS) in the pipeline) and the criminal law/policing field (the Europol database and part of the SIS database being prime examples). Political reactions to terrorist attacks this decade have led to calls for increasingly linking these databases (notwithstanding their different purpose) and increasing their ‘interoperability’ – a strategy clearly visible in the 2004 Hague Programme, a five-year renewal of the EU Justice and Home Affairs strategy. The Hague Programme also calls for the further facilitation of bilateral information exchanges in the police field under the so-called ‘principle of availability’ and for the ‘deepening’ of surveillance by the use of biometrics in the various databases. © Cambridge University Press 2008 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",,,"Fijnaut, C.J.F., The 'Communitization'' of Police Cooperation in Western Europe (1993) Free Movement of Persons in Europe.

The twin issues ofdata protection and data security within what was the EU’s third pillar legal framework thereforecome to the fore. With the Lisbon Treaty reform of the EU, and the increased role of the Commissionin PJCCM policy areas, and the integration of the PJCCM provisions with what have traditionallybeen the pillar I activities of Frontex, the opportunity for streamlining the data protection and datasecurity provisions of the law enforcement bodies of the post-Lisbon EU arises. This is recognisedby the Commission in their drafting of an amending regulation for Frontex2, when they say thatthey would prefer “to return to the question of personal data in the context of the overall strategyfor information exchange to be presented later this year and also taking into account the reflectionto be carried out on how to further develop cooperation between agencies in the justice and homeaffairs field as requested by the Stockholm programme.”3 The focus of the literature published onthis topic, has for the most part, been on the data protection provisions in Pillar I, EC. While thefocus of research has recently sifted to the previously Pillar III PJCCM provisions on data protection,4a more focused analysis of the interlocking issues of data protection and data security needs to bemade in the context of the law enforcement bodies, particularly with regard to those which werebased in the pre-Lisbon third pillar. This paper will make a contribution to that debate, arguing thata review of both the data protection and security provision post-Lisbon is required, not only inorder to reinforce individual rights, but also inter-agency operability in combating cross-border EUcrime. The EC’s provisions on data protection, as enshrined by Directive 95/46/EC, do not apply tothe legal frameworks covering developments within the third pillar of the EU. Even CouncilFramework Decision 2008/977/JHA, which is supposed to cover data protection provisions withinPJCCM expressly states that its provisions do not apply to “Europol, Eurojust, the SchengenInformation System (SIS)” or to the Customs Information System (CIS). In addition, the post Treaty ofPrüm provisions covering the sharing of DNA profiles, dactyloscopic data and vehicle registrationdata pursuant to Council Decision 2008/615/JHA, are not to be covered by the provisions of the2008 Framework Decision. As stated by Hijmans and Scirocco, the regime is “best defined as apatchwork of data protection regimes”, with “no legal framework which is stable and unequivocal,like Directive 95/46/EC in the First pillar”.5 Data security issues are also key to the sharing of data in organised crime or counterterrorism situations. This article will critically analyse the current legalframework for data protection and security within the third pillar of the EU. © 2010, Journal of Contemporary European Research.

The number of border management tools has substantially expanded and includes simple fences and more sophisticated optical and electro-optical sensors, information technology (IT) intrusion detection systems, biometrical and patterns sensors and systems, manned and unmanned aircrafts, as well as intelligent surveillance means. Altogether, the border management security market amounts to C22 billion in the US and C10 billion in Europe. In addition, a multitude of ‘stakeholders’ has largely expanded to include not only traditional border management actors (e.g. the DG Justice and the DG Home Affairs in the European Commission, Interpol, Europol or the Customs Cooperation Working Party), but also the European Union AntiFraud Office (OLAF), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) programme, the Joint Research Centre (JRC), the European Union Satellite Centre (EUSC), the European Defence Agency (EDA) or the European Security Research and Innovation Forum (ESRIF). Operational cooperation on border management is mostly structured around the activities of the European Patrol Network and the External Borders Agency Frontex (joint operations, Focal Points, Rapid Border Intervention Teams, risk analysis, training, technical assistance to Member States), which is the focus of the next chapter. The implementation of these measures is supported through the use of burden-sharing tools like the Schengen Facility (e.g. C400 million for Romania and Bulgaria in 2007-2009) and the External Border Fund, which amounts to C1.82 billion for the period 2007-2013, the major part of which is distributed among Member States depending on their burden regarding external border controls and visa policy. Several new legislative proposals are in the making concerning, among others, the amendment of the Schengen Borders Code, setting up an Entry Exit System (EES) and a Registered Traveller Programme (RTP), as well as the start of operations of the Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ). These developments give rise to an intricate system for the defence of the EU’s realm where the construction of the border depends on its dislocation, both political and spatial. The three clusters of border policy repertoires described in this chapter, surveillance, smart borders and integrated border management, epitomise the emerging practice the EU has engaged in. They reflect the ‘pushing-out of borders’ in two distinctive ways: through technological devices and a particular relationship with the neighbour. The latter relies on attempts to prevent the border-related threat from entering the EU’s realm by shifting increasing responsibility to contain it onto the neighbour. This move is accompanied by conditionality (e.g. the pressure towards readmission tied with the promises of visa facilitation) and the projection of the EU political and social model geared at a systemic reform of the neighbour. A quote from the EU Internal Security Strategy (ISS) reflects the rationale underpinning this logic: ‘The quality of our democracy and public confidence in the Union will depend to a large extent on our ability to guarantee security and stability in Europe and to work with our neighbours and partners to address the root causes of the internal security problems faced by the EU’ (European Council 2010b: 9). Here the externally assisted reform, most explicitly in our case integrated border management and security sector reform, turn into modern state-building.1. © 2012 Selection and editorial material, Christian Kaunert, Sarah Léonard and Patryk Pawlak.",,,,,,"Taylor and Francis",,9781136332777; 9780415677943,,,"English","European Homeland Security: A European Strategy in the Mak.?",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123146228

However, the research on these security measures has focused almost solely on their effect on liberty, human rights, and the like. Not much attention has been given to the actual effectiveness of the security remedies taken in the European Union (EU) to compensate for the abolition of border controls, despite effectiveness being an obvious source of legitimacy in the realm of security. This article takes a first step in the direction of correcting this neglect and develops the foundations for an analytical framework focusing on effectiveness and legitimacy. The framework is illustrated through a minor analysis of the legal and institutional set-up of SIS and Eurodac as examples pointing to sources of ineffectiveness in the very set-up of the databases. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","effectiveness; Eurodac; European Union; legitimacy; output; security; SIS",,"Anderson, M., Apap, J., Changing conceptions of security and their implications for EU justice and Home Affairs Cooperation (2002) CEPS policy brief, 26, pp. 1-14; Apap, J., Carrera, S., Maintaining security within borders: toward a permanent state of emergency in the EU?

The central concern of the article is how these technologies of extraterritorialisation, as deployed by the state, function to constitute regimes of statist visuality that produce both symbolic and physical forms of violence for their target subjects. In the course of the article, I critically examine the European Union’s EUROSUR project, Frontex and its Eurodac system and Australia’s Migration Legislation Amendment (Identification and Authentication) Act 2004 in order to stage a comparison of the various modalities of statist visuality deployed by states in their biopolitical governance of irregular migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, and to bring into critical focus the often lethal effects of these regimes of statist visuality. I conclude by presenting a form of counter-visuality to the state’s way of seeing by discussing the work of the contemporary Moroccan-French visual artist Bouchra Khalili, whose Mapping Journey Project stands as an agentic resignification and reclamation of the fraught journeys of irregular migrants through the surveilled lands of the global North. © 2015 Routledge.

Following the 2015 migration crisis, the shortcomings of the EU asylum system became strikingly evident. The subsequent terrorist attacks inaugurated the beginning of a series of revisions to databases used for border control, the registration of asylum seekers and visa applicants, or for alerts regarding criminals. As a final step, the Commission issued two proposals to render all EU databases interoperable in order to provide authorities with better information to tackle identity fraud, prevent irregular migration and mitigate security risks. In May 2019, the Interoperability Regulations were adopted by the co-legislators. Europol and Frontex, two EU Agencies that have been actively engaged in a wide range of operational activities at the external Schengen borders, will be authorized to consult and may subsequently request full access to the interoperable system. This contribution will address some of the concerns that emerge with the connection of originally disconnected databases and seeks to analyse the discrepancies that may arise in the context of interoperability where systematic data exchanges take place between actors that apply different data protection regimes. © 2020 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands","AFSJ;

Specifically, I examine the expanding scope and implications of biometric surveillance technologies in liberal states’ border securitization practices. Since 9/11, biometric identification systems have been fast‐tracked as a “silver‐bullet solution” to address perceived threats to border security in the United States and the European Union. I argue that the deployment of new information and biometric technologies in the United States and the European Union is both individuating and expanding state space into new geographies (i.e., state control is extensifying inside bodies and reaching outside sovereign territorial boundaries). This is due, in part, to the deployment and growing interoperability of new border securitization technologies, like US‐VISIT in the United States and the second generation of the Schengen Information System (SIS II) and Visa Information System (VIS) in the European Union. Biometric systems augment efforts to create a high‐concept, multi‐layered, interoperable system of “virtual borders” designed to deter or intercept determined terrorists, criminals, and unauthorized migrants. As the deployment of biometric technologies creep from the margins to the mainstream, privacy and surveillance concerns will become evermore salient. Equally important are the implications of this incremental “disembodied integration” of people with states on how liberal bionetwork societies make decisions about belonging and exclusion. As virtual borders extend into our bodies and around the globe, securitization measures that intersect bodies and states require a virtual theory to account for these new geographies of state space and the qualitative affects on individuals. © 2007, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,"Ackleson, J., Border Security Technologies: Local and Regional Implications (2005) Review of Policy Research, 22 (2), pp. 137-156; Agamben, G., (1998) Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life, , Heller‐Roazen D., (ed), Stanford: Stanford University Press, Edited by; Agamben, G., Bodies Without Words: Against the Biopolitical Tatoo (2004) German Law Journal, 5, pp. 367-369; Agathangelou, A.M., Ling, L.H.M., Power, Borders, Security, Wealth: Lessons of Violence and Desire from September 11 (2004) International Studies Quarterly, 48, pp. 517-538; Alkire, S., (2001) A Conceptual Framework for Human Security.

It is based upon an analysis of special data records, including surveillance of national and alien suspects, asylum and deportations, 'border repulsion of undesirable persons', etc. provided to the press by the Greek Schengen Bureau. Some comparisons are made with other Schengen counterparts. The analysis illustrates those particular geopolitical and sociopolitical control imperatives that actually affect the efficiency of the Schengen Agreement in Greece. Based also on other documented evidence, I conclude that Schengen's impact is a mixed blessing for Greek and European citizens as regards both their free movement, and also potential violations of their privacy and civil liberties. It is clearly an 'immigration anathema' to build a 'Fortress Europe', especially as regards Third World immigrants' and refugees' rights and life chances in the EU.","Asylum-seekers; Fortress Europe; Greece; Immigrants; Schengen information system","asylum seeker; human rights; immigrant population; immigration policy; Greece","Gordon, P., (1989) Policing Immigration: Britain's Internal Controls, , London: Pluto Press; Guild, E., Niessen, J., (1996) The Developing Immigration and Asylum Policies of the EU, , The Hague: Kluwer Law International; Huysmans, J., Migrants as a security problem: Dangers of ""securitizing"" societal issues (1995) Migration and European Integration, pp. 53-72. , Miles, R. and Thränhardt, D.

Drawing from the tension between the EU’s attempt to achieve watertight border controls by means of biometric technologies, and migrants’ persistence to move to and live in the EU, the volume pursues two interrelated objectives: first, it studies the encounters between migrants and the Visa Information System (VIS), one of the largest biometric databases in the world, from the perspective of mobility in order to investigate how migrants appropriate mobility via Schengen visa within and against this biometric border regime. Second, it addresses criticisms of autonomy of migration in order to develop it as a viable approach for border, migration and critical security studies. Hence, the book is driven by two interrelated research questions: what does the assertion of moments of autonomy of migration refer to in the context of border regimes that use biometrics to turn migrants’ bodies into a means of mobility control? And how do migrants appropriate mobility via Schengen visa within and against biometric border regimes? This book will be of great interest to scholars in border, migration and critical security studies, as well as researchers engaged in citizenship studies, surveillance studies, political theory, critical IR theory and international political sociology. © 2019 Stephan Scheel.",,,"Alabi, M.A., Omwenyeke, S., Pech, M., Samsa, G., Keine Romantisierung, bitte. “Autonomie der Migration�? im Streitgespräch (2004) Analyse & Kritik, (482), pp. 16-19; Andrijasevic, R., From Exemption to Excess: Detention and Deportations Across the Mediterranean Space (2010) The Deportation Regime: Sovereignity, Space and the Freedom of Movement, pp. 147-165. , edited by Nicholas de Genova and Nathalie Preutz, Durham, NC and London: Duke University Press; Bauder, H., (2013) Why We Should Use the Term Illegalized Immigrant.

As its name suggests, the concept of autonomy of migration's core thesis proposes that migratory movements yield moments of autonomy in regards to any attempt to control and regulate them. Yet, the concept of autonomy of migration has been repeatedly accused of being based on and contributing to a romanticisation of migration. After outlining two advantages the concept of autonomy of migration offers for the analysis of biometric border regimes, I demonstrate that processes of biometric rebordering increase the warranty of the two allegations, which feed this major critique. Drawing on examples relating to the Visa Information System, I show that processes of biometric rebordering alter the practical terms and material conditions for moments of autonomy of migration to such an extent that it becomes necessary to rethink not only some of the concept of autonomy of migration's central features, but the notion of autonomy itself. In the final section, I therefore point out some directions to develop the concept of autonomy of migration as an approach, which is better equipped to investigate today's struggles of migration without being prone to the critique of implicating a romanticisation of migration. © The Author(s) 2013.","Autonomy of migration; biometric rebordering; securitisation; security dispositif; situated knowledge",,"Boutang, Y.M., Interview (1993) Materialien Für Einen Neuen Antiimperialismus, 5, p. 38. , Berlin, Göttingen: Schwarze Risse/Rote Straße, Emphasis in original; Boutang, Y.M., Europa, Autonomie der Migration, Biopolitik (2007) Empire Und Die Biopolitische Wende: Die Internationale Diskussion Im Anschluss An Negri Und Hardt, p. 167. , eds.

As 'the object of the study is thought of as mobile and multiply situated', the endeavour of multi-sited research lies in this case in tracing and tracking migrants' encounters with border controls across and within multiple sites; Marcus, G., Ethnography In/Of the World-System: The Emergence of Multi-Sited Geography (1995) Annual Review of Anthropology, 24 (1), pp. 102-197; Guild, E., Carrera, S., Geyer, F., The Commission's New Border Package: Does It Take Us One Step Closer to a ""Cyber-fortress Europe""?

The usage of biometric technologies in conjunction with the related risk management approach implicates, however, that unrestricted mobility is only available to those who make themselves completely transparent to border control authorities, as security is equated with visibility; Muller, B., Security, Risk, p. 95; Bigo, D., Along similar lines, argues that the technologisation of border controls ultimately translates freedom of movement into evermore pervasive dataveillanc; Bigo, D., Freedom and Speed in Enlarged Borderzones (2011) The Contested Politics of Mobility: Borderzones and Irregularity, , ed.

But the implications of this stance for the CAM's core thesis and the underlying understanding of autonomy have remained unexplored so far; Rygiel, K., Governing Borderzones of Mobility Through E-borders, p. 148; Muller, B., Security, Risk, p. 12; Template refers to digital representations of particular biometric characteristics, which are generated by means of algorithms. These templates can be stored, exchanged, searched and matched by computers, which fulfil these tasks much faster and more efficiently than human beings, thereby allowing for the move from human to automated border controls, The crucial innovation lies, then, not so much in the usage of biometric characteristics for the verification of a person's claimed identity, but in the move from analogous information (photography of people's faces in passports or a simple ink fingerprint) to digital information; Muller, B., Security, Risk, p. 22. , See; Adey, P., Mobilities and Modulations: The Airport as a Difference Machine (2008) Politics At the Airport, pp. 153-156. , ed. Mark B. Salter, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press; Bigo, D., Freedom and Speed, , In the end, trusted traveller programmes intensify the controls not only for those categorised as 'high risk', but also for the 'trusted travellers' themselves as a biometric passport and 'background checks of varying range of intrusiveness' are preconditions for the participation in such a scheme; Muller, B., Travelers, Borders, Dangers: Locating the Political at the Biometric Border (2008) Politics At the Airport, pp. 136-137. , Mark B.

But while its effects are well examined in migration and border studies, less is known about the intricate ways in which biometric bordering is politically negotiated and socio-technically put into practice. Therefore, in this paper, I trace the contested emergence of one particular scheme of biometric border control currently in the making: the EU’s Smart Borders Package. Proposed by the European Commission in 2013, it aims at digitally registering all third-country nationals’ entries to and exits from the Schengen area, while simultaneously accelerating the border crossing of certain travellers. I argue that, unlike other forms of biometric bordering, the Smart Borders Package problematises border control primarily on the level of its temporalities and constitutes the speed of border crossings, the timing of control as well as third-country nationals’ duration of stay as distinct objects of governing. Meanwhile, the project’s political negotiations have sparked techno-political controversies that repeatedly brought it to the brink of failure. Yet, these controversies have significantly enhanced the intelligibility and practicability of biometric bordering, contributing to the emergence of what I call the self-service border. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Biometrics; border control; EU smart border; technology; temporality","biometry; border region; European Union; immigration policy; international migration; technology adoption; Europe","Amoore, L., Biometric Borders: Governing Mobilities in the War on Terror (2006) Political Geography, 25 (3), pp. 336-351; Barry, A., Technological Zones (2006) European Journal of Social Theory, 9 (2), pp. 239-253; Barry, A., Political Situations: Knowledge Controversies in Transnational Governance (2012) Critical Policy Studies, 6 (3), pp. 324-336; Bigo, D., Carrera, S., Hayes, B., Hernanz, N., Jeandesboz, J., (2012) Evaluating Current and Forthcoming Proposals on JHA Databases and a Smart Borders System at EU External Borders, , Brussels: European Parliament; Broeders, D., The New Digital Borders of Europe: EU Databases and the Surveillance of Irregular Migrants (2007) International Sociology, 22 (1), pp. 71-92; Broeders, D., A European ‘Border’ Surveillance System under Construction (2011) Migration and the New Technological Borders of Europe, pp. 40-67. , Dijstelbloem H., Meijer A., (eds), Basingstoke: Palgrave MacMillan,. edited by; Broeders, D., Hampshire, J., Dreaming of Seamless Borders: ICTs and the Pre-emptive Governance of Mobility in Europe (2013) Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, 39 (8), pp. 1201-1218; Carrera, S., Hernanz, N., Re-framing Mobility and Identity Controls: The Next Generation of the EU Migration Management Toolkit (2015) Journal of Borderlands Studies, 30 (1), pp. 69-84; Casas-Cortes, M., Cobarrubias, S., de Genova, N., Garelli, G., Grappi, G., Heller, C., Hess, S., New Keywords: Migration and Borders (2015) Cultural Studies, 29 (1), pp. 55-87; Collyer, M., de Haas, H., Düvell, F., Critical Approaches to Transit Migration (2012) Population, Space and Place, 18 (4), pp. 407-414; (2013), Outcome of Proceedings from Strategic Committee on Immigration, Frontiers and Asylum (SCIFA) on 21 November 2013. 17127/13; (2013), Outcome of Proceedings of Working Party on Frontiers on 28-29 May 2013. 11143/13; (2014), Approach for the Way Forward on the Smart Borders Package. 5828/14; (2014), The Scope of the Study on the Smart Borders Package. 6993/14; Dean, M., (2010) Governmentality: Power and Rule in Modern Society, , 2nd ed, London: : Sage; Dijstelbloem, H., Broeders, D., Border Surveillance, Mobility Management and the Shaping of Non-publics in Europe (2015) European Journal of Social Theory, 18 (1), pp. 21-38; Dijstelbloem, H., Meijer, A., (2011) Migration and the New Technological Borders of Europe, , Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, and, eds; Epstein, C., Guilty Bodies, Productive Bodies, Destructive Bodies: Crossing the Biometric Borders (2007) International Political Sociology, 1 (2), pp. 149-164; Eule, T.G., Loher, D., Wyss, A., Contested Control at the Margins of the State (2018) Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, 44 (16), pp. 2717-2729; (2015), Testing the Borders of the Future.

This article describes the multiplicity and diversity of these instruments. To analyse them more clearly, it distinguishes three types: legal, organisational and technological. The article equally points to the increasing relevance of technological tools, especially the use of biometrics. It also looks at how a founding member of the EU, France, and an associated country, Switzerland, utilise these European instruments to deport foreigners by focusing on the Dublin III Regulation as well as the Eurodac database, jointly referred to as the Dublin System. Grounding on a comparative study combining documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews and participant observation, this article describes the similarities and differences in the use of the Dublin System in these two countries. Moreover, it also reveals these countries’ specificities with regard to the roles played by local and national administrative bodies, and associative actors. The paper ends by concluding that to fully understand the deportation process in the European context as well as in certain countries, a multifaceted approach is required to make sense of the various interactions taking place between local, national and supranational frameworks, actors and practices. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","biometrics; Deportation; Dublin Regulation; Eurodac; European Union; France; Switzerland",,"Aas, K.F., The Body Does Not Lie’: Identity, Risk and Trust in Technoculture (2006) Crime, Media, Culture, 2 (2), pp. 143-158; Bigo, D., Guild, E., Policing at a Distance: Schengen Visa Policies (2005) Controlling Frontiers, pp. 233-274. , Bigo D., Guild E., (eds), Hants et Burlington: Ashgate, and,. edited by; Boswell, C., Geddes, A., (2011) Migration and Mobility in the European Union, , New York: Palgrave Macmillan; Broeders, D., The New Digital Borders of Europe: EU Databases and the Surveillance of Irregular Migrants (2007) International Sociology, 22 (1), pp. 71-92; Broeders, D., A European ‘Border’ Surveillance System Under Construction (2011) Migration and the New Technological Borders in Europe, pp. 40-67. , Dijstelbloem H., Meijer A., (eds), Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan,. edited by; Clarke, R., Human Identification in Information Systems (1994) Information Technology & People, 7 (4), pp. 6-37; (2018) Les conséquences économiques et financières de l’association de la Suisse à Schengen, , https://www.parlament.ch/centers/eparl/curia/2015/20153896/Bericht%20BR%20F.pdf, Bern: Rapport du Conseil fédéral en exécution du postulat 15.3896 du groupe socialiste.

It was noted in that Report that the existing problems in judicial and enforcement agencies’ cooperation across the EU made the use of national criminal records as a means of combating organised crime rather problematic. It was pointed out that practical problems hindered the speed, access and effectiveness of existing methods of cooperation and the creation and use of an ECR was the way forward for the effective combating of organised crime. Of course, the idea of using databases as a means of combating crime is not new. Practically all enforcement agencies around the world use ‘files’ (in paper or digital form) on crimes, suspects and methods (modus operandi) in an attempt to prevent crime or prosecute criminals. In fact, in recent years digital databases such as the Schengen Information System (SIS) have become the first line of defence against transnational organised crime and plans to update and develop further the system into a SIS II are on the way. What makes the proposal for an ECR different is the idea of an EU-wide dedicated database which addresses the problem directly: in other words, a dedicated database which contains information extracted from national criminal records on selected crimes. © Cambridge University Press 2008 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",,,"Stefanou, C., Xanthaki, H., (2005) Financial Crime in the EU: Criminal Records as Effective Tools or Missed Opportunities?, , (The Hague, Kluwer Law International); Stefanou, C., Organised Crime and the Use of EU-wide Databases (2006) International and European Financial Law, pp. 215-218. , I.

The regime is defined by a combination of three features: (i) a harmonisation of categories among the EU/Schengen member states, (ii) a growing use of new technology in networked databases and (iii) an increasing sorting of individuals based on security concerns. Although none of these features is new, the combination gives a new impetus to the European border control regime. The article concludes that the Lisbon Treaty and the Stockholm programme consolidate and strengthen existing trends. This implies that policies on border control, asylum, immigration, judicial cooperation and police cooperation are consolidated in a broader approach to border control, and that there is a strengthening of EU foreign policy within the European border control regime. The boundaries between previously dispersed policy areas are blurred. The combination of different aspects of security and various levels of authority requires coordination of policies with substantially different goals, and goes beyond mere border control.","Border control; Databases; Global Approach to Migration; Schengen; Security; Stockholm programme; Treaty of Lisbon",,"Angenendt, S., Die Zukunft der europäischen Migrationspoltik.

The state socialist Fordist type of commuting was gradually replaced by a new, post- Fordist structural type of commuting. An important element of the economic transition was the emerging of cross-border commuting, which became increasingly preferred after accession to the European Union and the Schengen area. Although the extent of cross-border commuting in terms of absolute numbers is negligable in Hungary, the growth trend its significant. The major spatial and demographic characteristics of daily commuting through the Austrian- Hungarian-Slovakian border is presented in a case study based on relevant statistical database. Regarding motivations for commuting across the border it can be stated that at the start economic reasons are the driving force, shifting into social reasons as time passes by. The main motivation behind commuting is the income gap on the labour market of the home and the host country. The dominant direction of commuting abroad is the west, and on a daily or weekly basis most people commute to Austria. Accordingly, municipalities strongly affected by crossborder commuting are concentrated next to the north-western and western border of Hungary. In Hungary, 70% of cross border commuters is male and nearly 60% is younger than 40 years of age. Most of them have secondary education with vocational certificate. They predominantly work in tourism, industry and construction industry.","Average salary; Circular mobility; Commuting; Cross-border commuting; Income gap; Labour market",,"Alpek, B.L., Tésits, R., Bokor, L., Group-specific Analysis of Commuting in the Most Disadvantaged Areas of Hungary (2016) Regional Statistics, 6 (1), pp. 54-81; Bartus, T., Területi különbségek és ingázás (2012) Nyugdíj, segély, közmunka: a magyar foglalkoztatáspolitika két évtizede, 1990-2010, pp. 247-258. , FAZEKAS, K.-SCHARLE, á.

Our paper will explore Eurodac, a large biometric information database concerning asylum applications and irregular border crossings, as part of the emerging European Big Data Economy. Drawing on the concept of the digital border and of the surveillance assemblage (Haggerty, Kevin D., and Richard V. Ericson. 2000. The Surveillant Assemblage. British Journal of Sociology 51, no. 4: 605–22) we understand Eurodac not only as a technological border but as inflected by social, symbolic, organizational and juridical cultures, practices, and imaginaries that are beyond the literal realm of the electronic space. Our paper investigates the dynamics of big data in the context of the integration of Eurodac within the larger framework of the European Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area freedom, security and justice (EU-LISA). EU-LISA is the operational platform of three large-scale European databases with regards to foreigners and their mobility within and towards Europe, namely Eurodac, the Schengen Information System (SIS II) and the Visa Information System (VIS).

It argues that the Commission's focus of attention has shifted from a data-base dominated approach to a drive to establish a legal framework within which prosecution can take place. After examining the in-built nature of cross-border crime, the article updates the status of previously established cross-border investigative databases. It goes on to discuss the transfer of Justice and Home Affairs from Third Pillar to First Pillar status within the Treaty of Amsterdam, arrangements for the incorporation of the Schengen acquis and proposals for the future work of Europol. It also raises the proposals to create a European Judicial area for the prosecution of fraud against the Community Budget and the institutions and offences covered by these proposals.

But the existence of databases ranging from the relatively unsophisticated Schengen Information System and the proposed European Information System to the UCLAF system to combat fraud raises many legal and criminological issues. There is a danger that the database and profiling approach exaggerates the scale of organised crime to excuse unwarranted interference with civil liberties, and it is not easy to keep large databases secure from hackers. There is no proper mechanism for complaining about abuses, and there may be inadequate protection for political dissidents. On the other hand pooling of information enables the authorities to allocate scarce resources to the most harmful crimes and can help to minimise unwarranted invasions of privacy. National SIRENE bureaux provide judicial and administrative checks by filtering individual requests for information from databases, and safeguards have been built into the procedures for accessing the IRENE-3 database.

Rather than IT rendering the body irrelevant to identity -a mistaken idea to begin with -the coupling of biometrics with IT unequivocally puts the body center stage. The questions to be raised about biometrics is how bodies will become related to identity, and what the normative and political ramifications of this coupling will be. Unlike the body rendered knowable in the biomedical sciences, biometrics generates a readable body: it transforms the body's surfaces and characteristics into digital codes and ciphers to be 'read' by a machine. ""Your iris is read, in the same way that your voice can be printed, and your fingerprint can be read"", by computers that, in turn, have become ""touch-sensitive"", and endowed with seeing and hearing capacities. Thus transformed into readable ""text"", the meaning and significance of the biometric body will be contingent upon ""context"", and the relations established with other ""texts"". These metaphors open up ways to investigate the different meanings that will become attached to the biometric body and the ways in which it will be tied to identity.

This article provides a legal analysis on the embedment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools at the EU level in information systems for TCNs and critically examines the fundamental rights concerns that ensue from the use AI to manage and control migration. It discusses automated risk assessment and algorithmic profiling used to examine applications for travel authorisations and Schengen visas, the shift towards the processing of facial images of TCNs and the creation of future-proof information systems that anticipate the use of facial recognition technology. The contribution understands information systems as enabling the datafication of mobility and as security tools in an era whereby a foreigner is risky by default. It is argued that a violation of the right to respect for private life is merely the gateway for a series of other fundamental rights which are impacted, such as nondiscrimination and right to effective remedies. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2021","Borders; Data protection; Discrimination; Fundamental rights; Information systems; Migration management",,"Bonditti, P., From territorial spaces to networks: A foucauldian approach to the implementation of biometry (2004) Alternatives: Global, Local, Political, 29, p. 465; Besters, M., Brom, F., Greedy” information technology: The digitalization of the European migration policy (2010) European Journal of Migration and Law, 12 (4), p. 455; Hayes, B., (2009) NeoConOpticon: The EU Security-Industrial Complex, p. 35. , Transnational Institute/Statewatch; Molnar, P., Technology on the margins: AI and global migration management from a human rights perspective (2019) Cambridge International Law Journal, 8 (2), p. 305; Molnar, P., Gill, L., (2018) Bots at the Gate: A Human Rights Analysis of Automated Decision-Making in Canada's Immigration and Asylum System, , University of Toronto; (2020) Opportunities and Challenges for the Use of Artificial Intelligence in Border Control, Migration and Security, , Commission; Dumbrava, C., (2021) Artificial Intelligence at EU Borders - Overview of Applications and Key Issues, , European Parliament Research Service; Vavoula, N., The “puzzle” of EU large-scale information systems for third-country nationals: Surveillance of movement and its challenges for privacy and data protection' (2020) European Law Review, 45 (3), p. 348. , For an overview; (2000) Convention Implementing the Schengen Agreement (CISA) of 14 June 1985, pp. L239-L319. , O; Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006 (2006) OJ, pp. L381-L384; Council Decision 2007/533/JHA (2007) OJ, pp. L205-L263; Regulation (EU) 2018/1860 (2018) OJ, pp. L312-L321; Regulation (EU) 2018/1861 (2018) OJ, pp. L312-L314; Regulation (EU) 2018/1862 (2018) OJ, pp. L312-L356; Brouwer, E., (2008) Digital Borders and Real Rights: Effective Remedies for Third-Country Nationals in the Schengen Information System, , Martinus Nijhoff; Brouwer, E., Schengen's Undesirable Aliens (2019) Caught in Between Borders - Citizens, Migrants, Humans: Liber Amicorum in Honour of Prof. Dr. Elspeth Guild, , Paul Minderhoud, Sandra Mantu and Karin Zwaan eds, Wolf Legal Publishers; Council decision 2004/512/EC (2004) OJ, pp. L213-L215; Regulation (EC) 767/2008 (2009) OJ, pp. L243-L251. , VIS Regulation; Council Decision 2008/633/JHA (2008) OJ, pp. L218-L1129; Regulation (EU) 2021/1134 (2021) OJ, pp. L248-L311. , 2021 VIS Regulation; Regulation 603/2013 (2013) OJ, pp. L180-L191; Regulation (EU) 604/2013 (2013) OJ, pp. L180-L231; Regulation (EU) 2018/1240 (2018) OJ, pp. L236-L241. , ETIAS Regulation; Regulation (EU) 2019/816 (2019) OJ, pp. L135-L141; Regulation (EU) 2019/817 (2019) OJ, pp. L135-L227; Regulation (EU) 2019/818 (2019) OJ, pp. L135-L185; Regulation (EU) 2021/1152 (2021) OJ, pp. L249-L315. , addition to Article 20, as mentioned earlier; Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (2016) OJ, pp. L119-L121; Alegre, S., Jeandesboz, J., Vavoula, N., (2017) European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS): Border Management, Fundamental Rights and Data Protection, pp. 23-26. , Study for the LIBE Committee of the European Parliament; Regulation (EU) 2021/1151 (2021) OJ, pp. L249-L257; Leese, M., The new profiling: Algorithms, Black Boxes, and the Failure of Anti-discriminatory Safeguards in the European Union (2014) Security Dialogue, 45 (5), p. 494; Directive (EU) 2016/681 (2016) OJ, pp. L11-L132. , also the contribution by Julien Jeandesboz in this special; (2018) Guidelines on Automated Individual Decision-Making and Profiling for the Purposes of Regulation 2016/679, p. 8. , Article 29 Working Party WP251; Joined Cases C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18 La Quadrature du Net and Others v Premier Ministre and Others (2020) EU, p. 791. , C; (2017) Fundamental Rights and the Interoperability of EU Information Systems: Borders and Security, p. 30. , FRA; (2018) Under Watchful Eyes: Biometrics, EU IT Systems and Fundamental Rights, pp. 81-94. , FRA; (2016) Commission, pp. 9-10. , COM 655final, 12; (2019) EU Information Systems Supporting Border Control - A Strong Tool, but More Focus Needed on Timely and Complete Data, pp. 29-30. , European Court of Auditors; (2018) Inaccurate Data in Schengen System “Threatens Rights, , https://euobserver.com/tickers/140468, euobserver, 8 January accessed 10 August 2021.

After a concise outline of the complex landscape within which these databases have been set up, emphasis is placed on the novelties and challenges that interoperability brings forward. In that regard, the articles evaluates the setting up of new databases, particularly the Biometric Matching Service and the Common Identity Repository – viewed through the Panopticon lens – the maximization of uses for which personal data may be destined, the revised rules on consultation of databases for law enforcement purposes, the challenge of ensuring data quality and the exercise of individual rights. If the EU uses its law enforcement and border control tools to the full, exploits the potential of inter-operability between information sources to identify any security concerns from a common pool of information, and uses the stage of entry into the EU as a key point for security checks to take place, the result will negate the ability of terrorist networks to exploit gaps. This is at the heart of the Security Union.1 © 2020 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands","Data Protection; Databases; ECRIS-TCN; EES; ETIAS; Eurodac; Interoperability; Privacy; SIS II; VIS",,"(2016), 1 COM 602 final, 4; (2019) OJ L135/27 (collectively Interoperability Regulations), , 2 Regulation (EU) 2019/817; (2019) OJ L135/85 (collectively Interoperability Regulations), , 3 Regulation (EU) 2019/818; 4 Article 2; Vavoula, Niovi, (2020) Immigration and Privacy in the Law of the European Union: The Case of Databases, , 5 For a detailed analysis (Brill Nijhoff, forthcoming); Vavoula, Niovi, Databases for Non-EU Nationals and the Right to Private Life: Towards a System of Generalised Surveillance of Movement?

For law enforcement purposes, there is also Regulation (EU) 2018/1862 (SIS II Regulations); 20 The fingerprint process is revised. Both the VIS and the Eurodac will store the fingerprints of third-country nationals over the age of six, whereas under the current rules the fingerprints are collected from individuals over the age of 12 (VIS) and 14 (Eurodac). Furthermore, as regards Eurodac, more categories of alphanumeric personal data will be collected. See Arts 10–12 of the recast Eurodac Proposal; According to Art. 17 of the recast Eurodac Proposal, the database will store the records on persons found irregularly crossing the external border of the EU for five years as opposed to eighteen months. The SIS II increased the retention period of alerts from three to five years, , 21; 22 For example, both Eurodac and the SIS II store records on irregular migrants. The EES will monitor the movement of third-country nationals covered by the VIS and the ETIAS. Convicted individuals' data will be stored in both the SIS II and the ECRIS-TCN; Databases could thus be conceived as the pieces of a puzzle.

The vast majority of these systems (VIS, Eurodac, EES, ETIAS) are conceptualised as multi-purpose tools, whereby their consultation for crime-related objectives is listed among their ancillary objectives. As a result, immigration records may be accessed by national law enforcement authorities and Europol for the purposes of fighting terrorism and other serious crimes under specified and limited conditions. Drawing from the relevant jurisprudence of the European Court, this article evaluates whether the EU rules on law enforcement access to EU immigration databases comply with the rights to respect for private life and protection of personal data, as enshrined in Article 7 and 8 of the EU Charter respectively.

The story begins in the mid-1980s with the evolution of European integration and the addition of borders to the list of responsibilities shared by the Member States and the EU (then European Community). In parallel, a more limited number of Member States decided to abolish their internal border controls within the framework of the so-called Schengen Agreement and Convention:1 a person allowed to enter the territory of one of the participating countries was automatically permitted to circulate within the Schengen area, without being subjected again to checks at the border. As irregular migrants and criminals were not excluded from free circulation, the dismantlement of internal checks was accompanied by so-called compensatory or flanking measures providing for, among other things, a common set of rules on external borders, short-stay visas and asylum applications.2 With the Treaty of Amsterdam, the law developed under the Schengen Convention, the so-called Schengen acquis, was integrated within EU law.3 At the same time, the EU competence in Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) that had been introduced with the Maastricht Treaty was modified to include the overarching objective of establishing an Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ).4 Since then, a substantial corpus of legislation regulating access to, stay in and removal from the Schengen area has been progressively constructed.5 Efforts to control the movement of non-EU nationals within the Schengen area have been coupled with efforts to prevent them from reaching the EU external border,6 thus necessitating action outside the physical border.7 In all of these developments, the growing tendency to associate non-EU nationals with irregular migration and criminality has been critical. Asylum and visa applications, as well as entry and exit procedures, have been instrumentalised for the purpose of the prevention and investigation of crimes, particularly of terrorism.8 More broadly speaking, security considerations have had a major impact in determining the objectives and rules of immigration control instruments.9. © Francesca Bignami 2020.",,,"Guild, E., (2001) European Community Law from a Migrant’s Perspective, , The Hague: Kluwer, chapters 7-8; den Boer, M., (1997) Schengen, Judicial Cooperation and Policy Coordination, , Maastricht: European Institute of Public Administration; Wagner, E., The Integration of Schengen into the Framework of the European Union (1998) Legal Issues of European Integration, 25 (2), pp. 1-60; Kuijper, P.J., Some Legal Problems Associated with the Communitarization of Policy on Visas, Asylum and Immigration under the Amsterdam Treaty and Incorporation of the Schengen Acquis (2000) Common Market Law Review, 37 (2), pp. 345-366; Bigo, D., Guild, E., (2005) Controlling Frontiers: Free Movement into and within Europe, , Aldershot: Ashgate; Mitsilegas, V., Human Rights, Terrorism and the Quest for ‘Border Security’ (2011) Individual Guarantees in the European Judicial Area in Criminal Matters, pp. 85-112. , eds.

At the same time, the author focuses on studying the legal framework, as well as the key elements of this policy. Author believes that the system of EU legal acts regulating visa relations should be qualified as EU visa legislation, which is one of the elements of a larger system of legal acts in the field of freedom of movement of persons. The EU visa policy has two key areas: the establishment of a visa / visa-free entry regime; the establishment of the procedure and conditions for issuing short stay visas. The latter area also includes issues related to the functioning of the Visa Information System. Currently, the EU realizes the reform of the visa policy, which covers both its directions. The analysis of the ongoing reform shows that the EU, on the one hand, seeks to strengthen external borders by creating additional control mechanisms, and. on the other hand, as a compensatory measure, creates more comfortable conditions for the entry of frequent and law-abiding travelers. © 2018 Institute of Europe Russian Academy of Sciences.

The current retrofitting and technological remediation of borders suggests their transformation away from static demarcators of hard territorial boundaries toward much more sophisticated, flexible, and mobile devices of tracking, filtration, and exclusion. Borders require the labor of software developers, designers, engineers, infrastructure builders, border guards, systems experts, and many others who produce the ""smart border""; but they also depend on the labor of ""data-ready"" travelers who produce themselves at the border, as well as the underground labor of those who traffic in informal and illegalized economies across such borders. Bordering increasingly relies on technological forms of mediation that are embedded within hi-tech, military and private corporate logics, but are also resisted by electronic and physical ""hacks"" or bypassing of informational and infrastructural architectures. In this paper we consider three socio-technological assemblages of the border, and the labor which makes and unmakes them: (1) the interlocking ""cyber-mobilities"" of contemporary airports including visual technologies for baggage, cargo, and passenger inspection, as well as information technologies for passenger dataveillance, air traffic control, and human resource systems; (2) the development of the Schengen Information System database of the EU, and its implications for wider migrant rights and internal mobility within the EU, as well as radical border media that have attempted to intervene in that border space; and (3) elements of the US-Mexico ""smart border"" regime known as the Secure Border Initiative Network (2006-2011), and those who have tried to tactically evade, disrupt, or undermine the working of this border. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","bio-informatics; mobility; security; smart border; tactical media",,"Adey, P., Secured and sorted mobilities: Examples from the airport (2004) Surveillance and Society, 1, pp. 500-519. , http://www.surveillance-and-society.org/issue4abstracts.htm; Adey, P., Surveillance at the airport: Surveilling mobility/mobilising surveillance (2004) Environment and Planning A, 36 (8), pp. 1365-1380; Adey, P., Facing airport security: Affect, biopolitics, and the preemptive securitisation of the mobile body (2009) Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 27 (2), pp. 274-295; Adey, P., (2010) Aerial life: Spaces, mobilities, affects, , Oxford,: Wiley-Blackwell; Amoore, L., Biometric borders: Governing mobilities in the war on terror (2006) Political Geography, 25 (3), pp. 336-351; Amoore, L., Hall, A., Taking people apart: Digitised dissection and the body at the border (2009) Environment and Planning D: Society & Space, 27 (3), pp. 444-464; Andreas, P., (2000) Border games: Policing the U.S.-Mexico divide, , Ithaca,: Cornell University Press; Bigo, D., Security and immigration: Towards a critique of the governmentality of Unease (2002) Alternatives: Global, Local, Political (Supplement), 27 (1), pp. 63-93; Bird, L., Dominguez, R., Global positioning: An interview with Ricardo Dominguez (2011), http://www.furtherfield.org/features/interviews/global-positioning-interview-ricardo-dominguez; Broeders, D., The new digital borders of Europe: EU databases and the surveillance of irregular migrants (2007) International Sociology, 22 (1), pp. 71-92; Casas-Cortes, M., Cobarrubias, S., Drawing escape tunnels through borders: Cartographic research experiments by European social movements (2007) An atlas of radical cartography, pp. 50-67. , In: Mogel Lize, Bhagat Alexis, editors Los Angeles,: Journal of Aesthetics and Protest Press; Censer, M., After major program is cancelled, contractors see opportunity (2011) Washington Post, , http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/after-major-program-is-canceled-contractors-see-opportunity/2011/05/16/AF0UXF9G_story.html, May; Chisti, M., Bergeron, D., Quiet demise of the virtual fence (2011) Migration Information Source, , http://www.migrationinformation.org/USfocus/display.cfm?ID=827, February; Cowen, D., A geography of logistics: Market authority and the security of supply chains (2010) Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 100 (3), pp. 600-620; Cowen, D., Rough trade: Logistics space and the citizenship of stuff, , Forthcoming, Minneapolis,: University of Minnesota Press; Der Derian, J., (2001) Virtuous war: Mapping the military-industrial-media-entertainment network, , Boulder,: Westview Press; Elliott, A., Urry, J., (2010) Mobile lives, , New York and London,: Routledge; Gordon, I., The death of SBInet?

Finishing of Motorway cross (parts of EU corridors 5 and 10) the country has moved in new era of faster, more accessible road traffic. At the same time many ITS systems were installed and upgraded to ensure smooth and safe traffic flow at the increasing traffic volumes. Several new tunnels were built, most notably Šentvid motorway tunnel, which has highest daily volume of all Slovenian tunnels. New traffic safety systems which were installed are presented in the paper. Open road traffic safety and driver information systems, largest national road ITS project, are also detailed. Advances have been made in the area of road weather sensors with unified information system and in emergency call systems with gradual transition to VoIP architecture. Four regional motorway control centres with full-time staff were established with all necessary infrastructures to monitor traffic situation and react in case of dangerous events by using VMSes or deploying field units. The focus of ITS in Slovenia was therefore on motorways, but there were several successful projects also outside of this scope. The intersection system of city of Ljubljana was increased from 117 to 207 intersections under central system control. Also, with entrance of Slovenia in Schengen area in 2007, the new customs service information system was put into operation featuring cargo vehicle control and tracking at the border crossings. This paper describes these various ITS project and experience learned during their installation and operation. It also provides some ideas for future development and enhancements.","ITS; Traffic management system; Tunnels","Advanced driver assistance systems; Advanced traffic management systems; Control system synthesis; Information systems; Internet telephony; Management information systems; Network architecture; Roads and streets; Safety engineering; Traffic control; Tunnels; Border crossings; Driver information systems; Emergency call systems; Gradual transition; ITS; Motorway tunnels; Traffic management systems; Traffic situations; Highway planning","Rijavec, R., Zorin, U., Using SITSA-C to define functionality and organisation of national traffic management centre (2010), V: 17th ITS World Congress, Busan, 2010 : proceedings; www.pti.fgg.uni-lj.si/sitsa, Website of SITSA-C, (7.9.2012); www.dars.si, Website od DARS, (04.09.2012)","Zorin, U.; DARS, Ulica XIV.
