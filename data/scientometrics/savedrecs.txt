EUROPEAN PUBLIC LAW			English	Article						Interoperability; Privacy; Data Protection; Databases; SIS II; VIS; Eurodac; EES; ETIAS; ECRIS-TCN		This article examines key privacy and data protection concerns raised by the Regulations that establish a framework for interoperability between EU-wide centralized information systems processing personal data of third-country nationals (Schengen Information System II, Visa Information System, Eurodac, Entry/Exit System, European Travel Information and Authorization System, European Criminal Records Information System for third-country nationals). After a concise outline of the complex landscape within which these databases have been set up, emphasis is placed on the novelties and challenges that interoperability brings forward. In that regard, the articles evaluates the setting up of new databases, particularly the Biometric Matching Service and the Common Identity Repository - viewed through the Panopticon lens - the maximization of uses for which personal data may be destined, the revised rules on consultation of databases for law enforcement purposes, the challenge of ensuring data quality and the exercise of individual rights.

J	Vavoula, N				Vavoula, Niovi			The "Puzzle" of EU Large-Scale Information Systems for Third-Country Nationals: Surveillance of Movement and Its Challenges for Privacy and Personal Data Protection	EUROPEAN LAW REVIEW			English	Article						Data protection; Data retention; Databases; EU law; Immigration policy; Interoperability; Personal data; Privacy; Surveillance; Third country nationals	BORDERS	The past three decades have been marked by the proliferation of EU databases processing various personal data collected from different categories of third-country nationals. At present, three databases are fully operational: the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II), the Visa Information System (VIS) and Eurodac. However, in the future three new databases will be set up: an Entry/Exit System (EES); a European Travel and Information Authorisation System (ETIAS); and a European Criminal Record Information System for third-country nationals (ECRIS-TCN). In addition, interoperability among these systems is in the making. By mapping the historical evolution of databases for third-country nationals in three distinct waves, this article demonstrates the progressive generalisation of their surveillance via the mass collection of their personal data, which are used for various purposes. Then, drawing on the jurisprudence of the European Courts, this article examines key privacy and data protection concerns about the necessity of setting up or maintaining information systems, their personal scope, the categories of personal data processed, access to stored data for law enforcement purposes and interoperability among the systems.

J	Broeders, D				Broeders, Dennis			The new digital borders of Europe - EU databases and the surveillance of irregular migrants	INTERNATIONAL SOCIOLOGY			English	Article						databases; European Union; irregular migration; social sorting; surveillance	IMMIGRATION	This article analyses the development of three EU migration databases and their significance for the internal control of irregular migrants. Because borders and immigration policy alone cannot stop irregular migration, many governments turn to internal migration control on settled irregular migrants. Surveillance of this group is aimed at their exclusion from key societal institutions, discouraging their stay and ultimately, the deportation of apprehended irregular migrants. These are policies in which identification of irregular migrants is crucial. In this age, registration and identification mean computerized and networked databases. The member states of the EU are currently developing a network of databases in the field of (irregular) immigration. The Schengen Information System (II), the Eurodac database and the Visa Information System are vast databases, often including biometric data, aimed at controlling migration flows and identifying and sorting legal and irregular migrants. These systems are able to 're-identify' parts of the population of irregular migrants on the basis of digital traces of their migration history. It is argued that the digital infrastructure that is now growing past its infancy is developing into a formidable tool for the surveillance of irregular migrants in Europe.

Through the SIS II, national authorities exchange information about individuals and objects, and this across national and institutional boundaries. Yet, the SIS II does not always perform as anticipated in its design scripts. Following common threads about infrastructural politics across Science and Technology Studies, political geography and critical security studies, we explore fragility and maintenance as being intrinsic to the functioning of data infrastructures and crucial sites of governance. We show how the SIS II is kept under continuous control to operate as a controlling data infrastructure. This article contributes to a critical inquiry into the datafication of border controls by interrogating how data acquire the status of allegedly credible and accurate information. Ultimately, this approach pinpoints the inherent fragility of seemingly mighty data infrastructures and casts a light on those actors and processes that sustain, through maintenance, contemporary digital borders.

'Greedy' Information Technology: The Digitalization of the European Migration Policy	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MIGRATION AND LAW			English	Article						digital borders; information technology; Schengen information system; illegal immigrants; European migration policy	DATABASES; BORDERS	European borders are being transformed into digital borders. The ambition behind the European information systems - like the Schengen Information System and Eurodac - is to establish a single Union information system to control the flux of migrants. We show that in this process information technology is not a neutral tool to reach established goals but that it is 'greedy'. This greediness indicates the distorting potential of information technology regarding the means-end logic. Our analysis suggests that the European migration policy is stuck in a 'digital fix', i.e. a technological fix focusing on ICT. We identify three political issues concerning greedy information technology within the context of the European migration policy. The first issue concerns the democratic control on information systems. The second issue discusses the weak legal position of immigrants. The third issue inquires into the effectiveness of information systems as a policy instrument.	[Besters, Michiel; Brom, Frans W.

J	Schuster, L				Schuster, Liza			Dublin II and Eurodac: examining the (un)intended(?) consequences	GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE			English	Article						EU asylum policy; Afghan asylum seekers; France; Greece	ASYLUM; NETWORKS	Although the numbers of asylum seekers in Europe is decreasing, the asylum policy of most European Union member states (EU MS) continues to be driven by a fear of a potential increase. As a result, EU MS refuse to address the growing numbers of people caught between Eurodac and Dublin II. These includes the many thousands who transit Greece and Spain, where in theory they should claim asylum, but where in reality they have little chance of being able to make a claim, and almost no chance of having it examined properly, much less being actually granted asylum. This article argues that the concern of EU MS is actually to reduce the number of those able to apply for asylum to an absolute minimum, rather than ensuring access to this status to anyone who might need it. Focusing on the 'waiting' of young Afghan men in Paris, this article seeks to show the daily suffering inflicted in pursuit of this policy goal.

This article describes the multiplicity and diversity of these instruments. To analyse them more clearly, it distinguishes three types: legal, organisational and technological. The article equally points to the increasing relevance of technological tools, especially the use of biometrics. It also looks at how a founding member of the EU, France, and an associated country, Switzerland, utilise these European instruments to deport foreigners by focusing on the Dublin III Regulation as well as the Eurodac database, jointly referred to as the Dublin System. Grounding on a comparative study combining documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews and participant observation, this article describes the similarities and differences in the use of the Dublin System in these two countries. Moreover, it also reveals these countries' specificities with regard to the roles played by local and national administrative bodies, and associative actors. The paper ends by concluding that to fully understand the deportation process in the European context as well as in certain countries, a multifaceted approach is required to make sense of the various interactions taking place between local, national and supranational frameworks, actors and practices.

J	Vavoula, N				Vavoula, Niovi			Information Sharing in the Dublin System: Remedies for Asylum Seekers In-Between Gaps in Judicial Protection and Interstate Trust	GERMAN LAW JOURNAL			English	Article						Eurodac; Dublin system; information sharing; composite procedure; asylum seekers	RIGHTS; MANAGEMENT; NETWORKS	In most EU policy areas, procedural cooperation between national administrations takes place through the shared implementation of "composite" decision-making procedures, facilitated by the operation of multijurisdictional networks or horizontal or vertical information exchange. In the context of asylum policy, such administrative cooperation has been necessary in the distribution of asylum seekers-in accordance with the Dublin III Regulation, which allocates responsibility among Member States to examine an asylum application. In addition to rules in the Regulation itself-Article 34-information sharing also takes place through Eurodac, an EU-wide centralized information system. This Article examines whether the Dublin system ensures effective judicial and administrative remedies in the operationalization of multijurisdictional information networks. It analyzes the relevant Eurodac and Dublin-related legislation, national implementation, and national case law through the lens of administrative cooperation. The assumption that the data exchanged has been acquired and processed lawfully, due to interstate trust, and the extent to which that assumption is rebuttable, are central themes throughout this Article. It is argued that administrative cooperation through information sharing takes precedence over the right to an effective remedy, and that, in practice, judicial and extrajudicial remedies are insufficient to protect asylum seekers.

J	Knaut, A				Knaut, Andrea			Border Control and Automated Biometric Identification Systems	KRIMINOLOGISCHES JOURNAL			German	Article						Biometrics; technology assessment; automation of border crossings; biometric identification; biometric border control; biometric identity; identity control; identity check		EURODAC, which stands for "European dactylographic system", is an automated fingerprint identification system that was established in 2002 and began operating in 2003. However, despite hundreds of thousands of fingerprints being processed through this system each year, Eurodac has received only very little media attention. In Europe, much of the public debate about the use of biometric technologies for the purpose of automated personal identification is centered on the gradual introduction of new biometric passports. To view biometric systems as black boxes" leads to erroneous conclusions about their effectiveness, both from a technophobic and a technophile point of view. Rather, on a technical, socio-economic and historical level, they should be understood as complex systems that integrate smaller computer systems which are being sold to state and private actors by different manufacturers. The use of biometric identification systems at national borders can be seen as being part of communicative processes in the negotiation of access to resources and power. And the technology itself is a disputatious actor not least because of its unavoidable measurement errors (though categorizable) and unpredictable interactions with human actors. Thus, political responsibility for who is and who is not granted access cannot simply be devolved unto biometric systems as allegedly infallible and unambiguous technical authorities.

J	Metcalfe, P				Metcalfe, Philippa			Autonomy of Migration and the Radical Imagination: Exploring Alternative Imaginaries within a Biometric Border	GEOPOLITICS			English	Article							SURVEILLANCE; CITIZENSHIP; MANAGEMENT; MOBILITY	This paper discusses biometric borders in Europe, focusing on the Eurodac database and practises of fingerprinting people on the move in Greece as a politicised attempt to control and limit secondary movement as set out in the Dublin Regulation. The paper presents empirical research to explore one way in which migrants in Athens negotiate Eurodac; where alternative imaginaries informed ideas of 'big' and 'small' fingerprints, shaping interactions with the asylum service as well as secondary movement. I use Autonomy of Migration (AoM) theories to depict borders as places of ongoing conflict, subjectivity and transformation and introduce the work of Castoriadis' social imaginaries and the radical imagination to explore migrants' alternative imaginaries. I argue that these occur at points of friction, within the constraints of, and alongside, a dominant socio-technical imaginary driving the proliferation of biometric border controls. I believe this enables a deeper understanding of the autonomy with AoM theories. Here, autonomy is presented as instances of self-creation, spurred on through the radical imagination and shaping moments of uncontrollability, where the subjective dimension of migration informs both meanings of autonomy as well as alternative imaginaries. Ultimately, I argue that these practices seek to disrupt and challenge the dominance of biometrics as a signifier of control, identity and truth.

The exclusion of `unwanted aliens' can be based on the mutual enforcement of national decisions, such as entry bans reported in the Schengen Information System, or objections against the issuing of a Schengen visa, based on the consultation procedure in the Visa Code. This contribution focuses on the right of TCN s to have access to effective remedies, both with regard to existing and newer mechanisms of exclusion. It argues that when dealing with the use of large-scale databases and risk assessment as basis for excluding admission, existing rules and case-law by the CJE U should be taken into account to ensure access to effective judicial protection for TCN s.

These systems generally contain millions of fingerprint samples. In order to improve the efficiency in seeking for suitable candidate reference data in such large-scale databases, studying indexing techniques for fingerprints is desirable. In this paper, we design a new indexing method using the features extracted from minutia details including location, direction and ridge information. Then a score-level fusion indexing approach is proposed by combing this new method with the minutia cylinder-code (MCC) indexing method. The results demonstrate the improvement of the proposed approach based on experiments on several public fingerprint databases.

This artificial vision is deployed in the erased territory, creating a white space in which to see from platforms, ranging from the ship, to the train and today's drones. The second section examines the Eurodac digital fingerprint database created by the European Union to monitor and control asylum seekers and refugees as an "artificial life system," to use a phrase coined by its administrators. In this automated form, artificial vision is distributed rather than centralized.

In this article, we critically evaluate that claim by developing a notion of deliberation along Habermasian lines, in which deliberation is understood as a process that induces negotiating partners to change positions through argumentation. Based on this conceptualization, we explore to what extent and under which conditions deliberation is likely to occur in intergovernmental settings. To that end, we analyse decision-making on the proposal to give law enforcement authorities access to the Visa Information System. We conclude that a ?thicker? conceptualization yields relatively few instances of deliberation. Moreover, we identify a number of specific conditions, and interrelationships between them, that are conducive to this kind of deliberation.

J	Majcher, I				Majcher, Izabella			The Schengen-wide entry ban: how are non-citizens' personal data protected?	JOURNAL OF ETHNIC AND MIGRATION STUDIES			English	Article; Early Access						Data protection; right to privacy; Schengen Information System (SIS); entry ban; Returns Directive	MIGRATION	The article addresses the Schengen-wide entry ban, which is one of the key measures laid down in the EU Returns Directive (2008/115/EC). The entry ban entails that a non-citizen expelled from one member state is barred from returning to the whole Schengen area for up to five years, or longer in case of a threat to public policy or national security. The pan-European validity of the entry ban is ensured by an alert entered in the Schengen Information System (SIS). The alert is a set of personal data registered in the SIS which states may process to identify the person with a view of the refusal of entry. Processing personal data of non-citizens may pose a challenge to the protection of their data. The article assesses data protection rules laid down in the SIS Regulation (Regulation 1987/2006) and the Regulation which will replace it (Regulation 2018/1861). As it argues, SIS-specific data protection safeguards are frequently narrower than rules under data protection law, including the General Data Protection Regulation and Council of Europe Convention 108, and fall short of requirements flowing from the right to privacy under the European Convention of Human Rights and EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.

We have analyzed the implementation of information security for the EU information systems EURODAC, SIS II and VIS in case of Estonia. The analysis comes in a situation, where there are multiple regulations, directives, guidelines; but it lacks a unified standard for the implementation of the member states subsystems. The main finding is that a separate standard is not necessary; however, there is a need for setting minimum requirements, ensuring security of the information systems, that come with appropriate guidelines that help the member states to achieve the minimum requirements. The second finding is that there is a need for greater cooperation and an increased knowledge exchange of the methods used in the member states. Following defined guidelines and exchanging knowledge would help to strengthen the level of security for the entire system.

The vast majority of these systems (yrs, Eurodac, EES, ETIAS) are conceptualised as multi-purpose tools, whereby their consultation for crime-related objectives is listed among their ancillary objectives. As a result, immigration records may be accessed by national law enforcement authorities and Europol for the purposes of fighting terrorism and other serious crimes under specified and limited conditions. Drawing from the relevant jurisprudence of the European Court, this article evaluates whether the EU rules on law enforcement access to EU immigration databases comply with the rights to respect for private life and protection of personal data, as enshrined in Article 7 and 8 of the EU Charter respectively. In addition, challenges posed by the forthcoming interoperability between databases are also examined.

In this paper, we propose a fingerprint indexing scheme at feature level fusion based on Minutiae Vicinity and Minutiae Cylindrical Code and a support-vector-machine-based learning algorithm is used to train the system using the feature extracted which will improve the efficiency in seeking a candidate reference list from large scale biometric data databases, where the personality related with the input data is dictated by contrasting it with each and every entry in the database. This coordinating procedure is tedious and conceivably increments, the rate of wrong identification, hence we propose a new fingerprint indexing approach which would improve the performance of the system.

At the same time, the author focuses on studying the legal framework, as well as the key elements of this policy. Author believes that the system of EU legal acts regulating visa relations should be qualified as EU visa legislation, which is one of the elements of a larger system of legal acts in the field of freedom of movement of persons. The EU visa policy has two key areas: the establishment of a visa / visa-free entry regime; the establishment of the procedure and conditions for issuing short stay visas. The latter area also includes issues related to the functioning of the Visa Information System. Currently, the EU realizes the reform of the visa policy, which covers both its directions. The analysis of the ongoing reform shows that the EU, on the one hand, seeks to strengthen external borders by creating additional control mechanisms, and, on the other hand, as a compensatory measure, creates more comfortable conditions for the entry of frequent and law-abiding travelers.

It is observed that the latter is based mainly on a data protection perspective. From this data protection point of view, the handling of biometric data in the EU would benefit from a more stringent application of the purpose binding principle. Further, it is demonstrated that more thorough impact assessments could become the cornerstone for legal assessments of the application of data protection principles in individual biometric projects such as EURODAC. The conclusion is that the current approach to informational trends and biometrics will have to develop beyond personal data protection towards a more comprehensive notion of societal data protection through privacy enhancing data and identity management. Within this wider framework, data protection should be able to deal with the use of biometrics and multiple layers and concepts of privacy created by the information society as it is developing.

New cross-border regimes of biometrics and databasing in the EU are contributing to a conflation of the treatment of irregularity, asylum seeking, and criminality. States provide migrants' biometric data to transnational databases that are increasingly interoperable in the area of migration and crime control, to be accessible for state-based law enforcement actors. This article uses the case of Eurodac - a biometric database initially developed for migration control purposes - to explore the ongoing expansion of law enforcement access to the collected information for the purpose of crime control. The article studies how borders are selectively made permeable for biometric data flows in the light of "crimmigration" discourses. It combines insights from critical migration, border, and security studies that address the increasing overlapping of migration and crime control in policy discourse, law, and surveillance technologies. The study addresses the reconfiguration of crimmigration - and the normalisation and diversification of the figure of the "crimmigrant other" - through the expansion of cross-border flows of biometric data by law enforcement.

J	Glouftsios, G; Scheel, S				Glouftsios, Georgios; Scheel, Stephan			An inquiry into the digitisation of border and migration management: performativity, contestation and heterogeneous engineering	THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY			English	Article						biometrics; borders; migration management; mobility control; science and technology studies (STS); Visa Information System (VIS)	SECURITY; TECHNOLOGY; GOVERNANCE; KNOWLEDGE; TERMS; WAR	This article is concerned with the digitisation of border security and migration management. Illustrated through an encounter between a migrant and the Visa Information System (VIS) - one of the largest migration-related biometric databases worldwide - the article's first part outlines three implications of digitisation. We argue that the VIS assembles a set of previously unconnected state authorities into a group of end users who enact border security and migration management through the gathering, processing and sharing of data; facilitates the practice of traceability, understood as a rationality of mobility control; and has restrictive effects on migrants' capacity to manoeuvre and resist control. Given these implications, the article's second part introduces three analytical sensitivities that help to avoid some analytical traps when studying digitisation processes. These sensitivities take their cue from insights and concepts in science and technology studies (STS), specifically material semiotics/ANT approaches. They concern, firstly, the ways that data-based security practices perform the identities of the individuals that they target; secondly, the need to consider possible practices of subversion by migrants to avoid control-biased analyses; and finally, the challenge to study the design and development of border security technologies without falling into either technological or socio-political determinism.

This reform, among other countless aspects, has increased the effective EU Information Management as the key to protect external borders, improve the management of migration flows and contribute to the enhancement of internal security. The applicable data protection legislation is significantly fragmented, complex and diffuse since, despite the GDPR excludes from its scope asylum-related activities, border control, and immigration is directly defined in the proposed Dublin IV, Procedures and Eurodac regulations. At the same time, the persistent linkages to the security of Member States can reflect the potential application of the Data Protection Directive on Police Matters. In addition, the interoperability of different information systems, the deployment of specific bodies (such as Frontex or EASO) as well as law enforcement authorities are bound directly by their own regulations. Consequently, this fragmented and particularly complex legal framework constitutes the subject of the study.

J	Scheel, S				Scheel, Stephan			Autonomy of Migration Despite Its Securitisation? Facing the Terms and Conditions of Biometric Rebordering	MILLENNIUM-JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES			English	Article						Autonomy of migration; biometric rebordering; securitisation; security dispositif; situated knowledge		This article reconsiders the concept of autonomy of migration in the context of technologically ever-more sophisticated border regimes by focusing on the case of biometric rebordering. As its name suggests, the concept of autonomy of migration's core thesis proposes that migratory movements yield moments of autonomy in regards to any attempt to control and regulate them. Yet, the concept of autonomy of migration has been repeatedly accused of being based on and contributing to a romanticisation of migration. After outlining two advantages the concept of autonomy of migration offers for the analysis of biometric border regimes, I demonstrate that processes of biometric rebordering increase the warranty of the two allegations, which feed this major critique. Drawing on examples relating to the Visa Information System, I show that processes of biometric rebordering alter the practical terms and material conditions for moments of autonomy of migration to such an extent that it becomes necessary to rethink not only some of the concept of autonomy of migration's central features, but the notion of autonomy itself. In the final section, I therefore point out some directions to develop the concept of autonomy of migration as an approach, which is better equipped to investigate today's struggles of migration without being prone to the critique of implicating a romanticisation of migration.

J	Vukov, T; Sheller, M				Vukov, Tamara; Sheller, Mimi			Border work: surveillant assemblages, virtual fences, and tactical counter-media	SOCIAL SEMIOTICS			English	Article						smart border; bio-informatics; mobility; security; tactical media	SECURITY; AIRPORT; BIOPOLITICS; WAR	The new technologies of bio-informatic border security and remote surveillance that have emerged as key infrastructures of reconfigured mobility regimes depend on various kinds of labor to produce the effect of bordering. The current retrofitting and technological remediation of borders suggests their transformation away from static demarcators of hard territorial boundaries toward much more sophisticated, flexible, and mobile devices of tracking, filtration, and exclusion. Borders require the labor of software developers, designers, engineers, infrastructure builders, border guards, systems experts, and many others who produce the "smart border"; but they also depend on the labor of "data-ready" travelers who produce themselves at the border, as well as the underground labor of those who traffic in informal and illegalized economies across such borders. Bordering increasingly relies on technological forms of mediation that are embedded within hi-tech, military and private corporate logics, but are also resisted by electronic and physical "hacks" or bypassing of informational and infrastructural architectures. In this paper we consider three socio-technological assemblages of the border, and the labor which makes and unmakes them: (1) the interlocking "cyber-mobilities" of contemporary airports including visual technologies for baggage, cargo, and passenger inspection, as well as information technologies for passenger dataveillance, air traffic control, and human resource systems; (2) the development of the Schengen Information System database of the EU, and its implications for wider migrant rights and internal mobility within the EU, as well as radical border media that have attempted to intervene in that border space; and (3) elements of the US-Mexico "smart border" regime known as the Secure Border Initiative Network (2006-2011), and those who have tried to tactically evade, disrupt, or undermine the working of this border.

J	Ajana, B				Ajana, Btihaj			Asylum, Identity Management and Biometric Control	JOURNAL OF REFUGEE STUDIES			English	Article						Agamben; asylum; biometrics; biopolitics; ICTs; refugees	BORDERS	The article addresses a particular aspect of the relationship between asylum issues and information and communication technologies (ICTs), namely the deployment and 'function creep' of biometrics within the field of asylum management. Current debates on this issue have been largely restricted to a technologically determinist approach that reduces the focus to problems of data misuse and privacy, precluding other pertinent ethical and political concerns. In response, the article engages with Giorgio Agamben's elaborations on the concepts of biopolitics and exception as an alternative way of analysing the use of biometric technology in the governance of forced migrants. It begins with a critical overview of Agamben's conceptualization of biopolitics and the state of exception. It then considers the Eurodac database and the UK's asylum Application Registration Cards as examples to demonstrate how current policies of immigration control and border management are implicated in the logic of exception. It argues that illiberal practices, such as biometric profiling and fingerprinting of asylum seekers and their incarceration in detention centres, are being enforced upon certain groups in ways that render their exclusion from the official juridico-political structure as an 'inclusive exclusion'. Importantly, the function creep of biometrics is not to be understood as the turning of exception into the rule in a somewhat homogenous way, but more as a polysemic process, which involves different forms of discipline and control that are irreducible to one singular paradigm.

Within this route, Serbia was the state that remained busiest in terms of irregular border crossings. Not only has it served as a transit country for the African and Asian migrants. Regarding its geographical position in the Western Balkans region, Serbia is also part of most of the subregional migration routes for the regional migrants mostly from Kosovo en route to the European Union. Therefore, the main aim of this article is to explore factors influencing the intensification of the transit migration through the Serbian territory after 2008. The research has been conducted as follows. In broader terms, it was necessary to search the reasons leading the irregular migrants to prefer the Western Balkan route to the other routes when coming to the European Union. Factors such as the security of the land and sea routes; the migration policies and border controls of the transit countries especially in the Middle East; the price for the transit or the road-traffic infrastructure have been taken into account. In the strict sense of the word, it was necessary to analyse changes in Serbian migration and asylum policy after 2008 regarding the formation of the Serbian asylum system and introduction of the visa free regime with the Schengen states. Furthermore we paid attention to the deficits of the Serbian asylum system, which make the irregular transit via Serbia easier, as well as the insufficient cooperation between Serbia and the European Union when using the systems restricting irregular migration flows in Europe, such as Dublin III regulation or Eurodac. Knowing the reasons for choosing the Western Balkan route and transit through Serbia is necessary in an attempt to forecast the evolution of the future migration flows to the European Union. Moreover, the ability to identify the factors causing the rising amounts of migrants on the particular route increases the chances of the state to prepare itself for the future migration flows in advance and to cope with the situation better.

J	Jurickova, V				Jurickova, V			Implementation consequences and costs of the European Union standards adoption	EKONOMICKY CASOPIS			Slovak	Article								The entry of the Slovak Republic into the EU will be connected with relatively high costs. The essential cause, however, is not the entry alone, but the forty-year interruption of the market economy development during which period individual areas of economy were largely neglected, and even destructed. The acceptance and implementation of acquis communateure will demand relatively large costs. The assets of EU Directives' implementation will act in a long term, costs linked with it will concentrate into short term and medium term horizon. Most extensive financial, requirements both from the state budget and from the entrepreneurial sphere and population as well will be requested in the sphere of environment. From the point of view of cost proportion linked with the implementation of EU standards and specifications relating to the environment complex one of the basic components is the waste management, above all communal waste storage. The important component is also water protection. Total costs invoked by the transition to the EU standards and specifications in the sphere of waterworks and sewerage of wastewaters represent the highest items within the environmental complex. The inevitability of investment expenditure to implement aquis in the sphere of water protection will invoke also some indirect effects. These will represent the development of activities of the Slovak construction companies of subcontractor type, and the creation of new jobs at the implementation of such projects. The third important segment in the system of environmental protection is air protection. This comprises the problems of municipalities (communal waste incineration) and,environmental problems in the entrepreneurial sphere. Particularly big gaps manifest themselves in the sphere of safety at work and health preservation at work, as even currently valid legal standards has not been consistently respected. Thus, the acceptation of aquis in this sphere too will be a relatively demanding and costly process. This refers above all to the implementation of the Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work and relative Directions. These Directives define minimum health and safety standards for concrete work situations. They relate to the requirements on workplaces, work facilities, construction sites, safety labelling as well as other requirements concerning safety at work and health protection at work. Social-economic dimensions play an important part within the process of acquis, communateure implementation. These represent above all a higher level of protection, culture and efficiency of labour and social relations. Transposition of aquis into the Slovak legislation in the sphere of social protection means among other things also the assurance of equal rights, equal treatment in the employment and profession, as well as equal rights of all citizens irrespective of their sex, race and religion, and protection against job discrimination. In the sphere of labour legislation, there are some problems with the Council Directive 93/104/EC of 23 November 1993 concerning certain aspects of the organization of working time. Its transposition into the new Labour Code where the maximum working hours overtime inclusive have been limited to 48 hours, has brought about other problems rather than purely cost invoking ones (in transport, post offices, in the sphere of culture). Unlike previous spheres, where social-economic dimensions prevail, the following spheres are characterised rather by technical and economic dimension prevalence. In the agriculture and foodstuff sector, the implementation of aquis is linked mostly with the adoption of the EU technical standards and with the finalising of institutional structures inevitable for the examination of the adherence to those standards. Timely preparation of all premises indispensable to obtain EU resources in this sector is particularly important. Most important task in implementation of EU technical standards is the assurance of sanitary faultlessness of foodstuffs and agricultural raw materials. Additional costs will be required for ensuring environmental standards in storage facilities and waste management; this will influence increased unit costs mainly in stock raising and pig breeding. From the point of view of Slovakia's entry into the EU transport has the irreplaceable task. In this chapter, Slovak Republic did not ask for any exceptions or transitional period for the implementation of aquis. The Government approved the National Plan of Regional Development for the Slovak Republic for the years 2001 - 2006, which is the official document of the Government regarding requirements to finance transport infrastructure from the EU pre-entry funds. The development programme of transport infrastructure comprises also two priorities construction of railway network (4 public works) and highway construction (3 public works). Basic priority of transport sector is the construction and modernisation of transport infrastructure in approved routes of multi modular corridors. Slovak Republic accepted the results of the TINA final report, which defined the survey of infrastructure projects for reconstruction, improvement or construction of infrastructure. Basic network of TINA includes corridor IV (end points Drazdany - Istanbul), corridore VI (Gdansk - Zilina), and branch Va from Bratislava to Kosice and then to Ukraine. European Union stated that the chapter does not require further negotiation. Progress. monitoring at the acceptance and implementation of aquis will go on during further negotiations. From the point of view of the implementation of EU standards energy sector is important. Slovakia's entry into the EU from the financial point of view relates mainly to supply safety and nuclear. Current insufficient capacity of emergency reserves of oil and oil products and the need to extend these capacities up to the parameters defined by the EU Directive, e. g. 90 day consumption compared to the current 39 day capacity will require considerable costs spent by public finance. Slovak commitment to phase out gradually units of a nuclear power plant VI will not influence public finance directly, and will be financed partially from foreign resources. To support financially this phase out and eventual further related activities that could arise, a Financial Memorandum was signed between Slovakia and the EU and a special account has been opened in the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. In compliance with the need to meet towards the year 2004 the EU Directives 96/92 and 98/30 Slovak Republic gradually liberalises its electricity and natural gas market. In the negotiation and implementation process, the sphere of internal safety, especially Schengen agreement, is of special importance. The main task of the Slovak Republic in this area is the protection of the Slovak-Ukraine border as an outer border of the extended EU. Increased costs to protect outer border will be, however, reflected in generally higher external and internal security of the Slovak Republic. This means the decreased number of illegal migrants, decreased custom offences, more efficient detection of illegal drug trafficking etc., which will, from the economy point of view, prepare conditions for relative future savings of the state budget. Slovak Republic as a future member of the EU can become, however, to a greater extent compared to current situation,a country of destination for refugees and asylum applicants. As early as in the year 2003 one expects the increase of the number of refugees up to about 10 thousand people. From the economy point of view the increase of Slovakia's internal safety resulting from the EU membership can influence positively the income from the active tourism (prospective abolition of border controls). Slovak Republic does not need to fulfil the conditions of the Schengen aquis, and connection to the Schengen information system towards the date of EU entry, must however, fulfil the conditions defined for the first phase of the system's application.
